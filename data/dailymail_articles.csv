Trump says he's 'beyond seriously' looking at 2024 run as he slams Biden on border saying 'all he had to do was leave it alone' and claims FDA paused Johnson & Johnson vaccine to help Pfizer,"Donald Trump is looking 'very seriously' at running for president again in 2024, he announced on Monday night, as he attacked Joe Biden for his handling of the southern border and returned to his 2016 campaign warning that Latin America was 'sending rapists' into the United States. In his first televised interview since leaving the White House, Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity that he was definitely weighing up a bid to retake the presidency. 'I am looking at it very seriously,' he said. 'Beyond seriously.' The former president also attacked the FDA, saying that the agency is protecting Pfizer by choosing to halt Johnson & Johnson's vaccination program. He said he believed his high poll ratings - what he termed his 'tremendous numbers' - was due to disappointment in Biden's rule. 'I've got tremendous numbers. Nobody has ever gotten the numbers I got. No sitting president has come even close. There is more popularity now the end there was the day before the election,' he said. But, the 74-year-old said he was not ready to officially declare his candidacy. 'From a legal standpoint, I don't want to really talk about it yet,' he added. Trump, speaking from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, said that he was most proud of 'helping people'. He singled out having reduced taxes, reduced the cost of prescription drugs, created Space Force, and built parts of a wall along the border with Mexico. The former president said he build 450 miles: the vast majority of the 450 miles was in fact repair or reinforcement of existing structures, and only 80 miles was newly created in locations where no barriers previously existed. He said that his immigration policies were working, telling Hannity that Biden's unpicking of his work was having a devastating effect. More than 170,000 migrants were taken into custody at the U.S.-Mexico border in March - the highest monthly total since at least 2006. 'All he had to do was leave it alone,' said Trump, pointing out that tens of thousands of migrants are currently arriving, and claiming that they were criminals and drug traffickers. 'They are sending us not their best people,' Trump said, reprising his infamous 2016 campaign claim. 'They are sending us people that in many cases - not in all cases - are murderers, drug dealers, human traffickers, rapists, really bad people. 'They are sending people from prisons.' Trump, who cut financial aid to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras in a bid to pressure them to stem the flows of migrants, said that the Biden administration was misguided in their discussion about restoring aid to the Central American nations, from where the majority of migrants currently arrive. He praised Mexico's leader, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and spoke warmly of their working relationship - despite their differing ideologies. The former president said that all his work on the border was being unpicked. 'It's a horrible situation,' he said. 'It could destroy our country. People are pouring in.' The billionaire businessman has bucked tradition by remaining firmly in the political fray on leaving the White House. While most former presidents, by convention and out of respect, refrain from commenting on their successor's first years, Trump has been issuing regular press releases and granting multiple interviews. He told Hannity that he was looking forward to campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates for the 2022 election, and said they should embrace his policies 'if they want to win'. He singled out Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his former press secretary who is running for the governor of Arkansas, and races to watch in Florida, North Carolina - where his daughter-in-law Lara is considering a Senate run - New Hampshire and Ohio. 'We've got to take back the house in '22,' he said. 'We have a real chance.' Turning to the coronavirus pandemic, Trump said that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 'hated' him, because he pushed them for a speedy approval of the COVID vaccines, and that Pfizer resented him for driving down the price of pharmaceuticals. He claimed that 'Pfizer is in with the FDA' - and alleged that the FDA deliberately thwarted Johnson & Johnson's vaccination program, in a bid to boost demand for Pfizer's alternative. Johnson & Johnson's COVID vaccine was called into question by the FDA last week after six people out of 6.8 million given the vaccine reported blood clots. One of them, a woman in Virginia, died. Trump said he felt the decision by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to warn against Johnson & Johnson's drug was 'so stupid.' He said: 'That is the worst thing they could have done from a public relations standpoint. 'They paused to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. And it probably affects the other vaccines a little bit. It has had a devastating impact. 'They get along with Pfizer so well. And Pfizer, Pfizer doesn't like me because I pushed them on prescription drugs. 'And I'll tell you something. I think it is very suspect what they did with Johnson & Johnson. 'Because the only people that are happy about that are Pfizer and Moderna.'",News,4/20/2021
'My words don't matter': Maxine Waters brushes off Chauvin judge who warned that her calls for BLM protests to be 'more confrontational' could overturn whole case after defense accused her of intimidating jury,"Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied on Monday interfering in the trial of Derek Chauvin, claiming that the judge overseeing the former policeman's case said her provocative words 'don't matter' - despite his condemning her actions in court as 'abhorrent'. Waters, a Democrat representing California, sparked outrage by travelling to Minneapolis on Saturday and urging protesters to 'get more confrontational' if Chauvin was acquitted. Her remarks, on the eve of the jury retiring to consider its verdict, were widely condemned andmay, it emerged on Monday, have handed Chauvin's defense grounds for appeal and the turning over of any guilty verdict. Yet Waters, 82, defiantly insisted on Monday afternoon that she stood by her words. 'The judge says my words don't matter,' she told CNN. When pressed on the judge stating that her remarks could be grounds for appeal, she replied: 'Oh no, no they didn't.' She insisted she was entirely justified in her call to action, saying: 'The whole Civil Rights movement is confrontational.' Earlier on Monday Waters' comments were seized upon by Chauvin's legal team, and criticized by the judge. Speaking after the jury was sent out on Monday afternoon, Chauvin's attorney Eric Nelson once again made a bid to have the case against his client thrown out on grounds that there was no way the jury could be untainted by the excessive publicity surrounding the case. 'Now that we have US representatives threatening acts of violence in relation to this trial it's frankly mind-blowing,' Nelson said. Taking it into consideration Judge Peter Cahill said:'I grant that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned.' Judge Cahill denied Nelson's move for a mistrial but he said: 'I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case. They should respect a co-equal branch of government.' He said that failure to do so was 'abhorrent', but added: 'I don't think it's given additional material with which to prejudice the jury. 'A congresswoman's opinion really doesn't matter a whole lot.' Waters (D - California) had joined protesters in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center on Saturday night for a demonstration over the death ofDaunte Wright, a 20-year-old black man shot dead by a white police officer during a traffic stop on April 11. Waters told the protesters that she will fight for justice on their behalf and urged them to'to get more confrontational' - just one day after protests descended into violence. 'I hope we get a verdict that says guilty, guilty, guilty,' she said of the Chauvin trial. 'And if we don't, we cannot go away. We've got to stay on the street. We get more active, we've got to get more confrontational. We've got to make sure that they know that we mean business.' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell likewise went after Waters on Monday, telling colleagues: 'It's harder to imagine anything more inappropriate than a member of Congress flying in from California to inform local leaders - not so subtly - that this defendant had better be found guilty or else there will be big trouble in the streets.' The Kentucky Republican said that Waters' demand for a guilty verdict was 'like somebody window-shopping or ordering off a menu.' 'Every single American deserves a fair trial. This is sacred. You do not balance the scales of justice by trying to tip them,' McConnell said. The top Senate Republican noted that through much of the country's 'quest for civil rights and equal justice has been the fight to get rid of extra-judicial violence, to get rid of rigged trials where the outcome was molded by public sentiment or angry mob.' 'It is beyond the pale for a sitting member of the United States Congress to look at what happened last summer and imply there should be some kind of a sequel if a legal case does not unfold as she thinks it should,' he said. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy took his criticism even further - saying that he is introducing a motion to censure Waters. Meanwhile House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Capitol Hill reporters Monday that Waters didn't need to apologize as her comments didn't incite violence, despite calls from Republicans to have Waters punished for her remarks. And White House press secretary Jen Psaki refused to condemn Waters' comments, telling reporters:'Well, I can speak to the president's view. He has been very clear that he recognizes the issue of police violence against people of color, communities of color is one of great anguish and it's exhausting and quite emotional at times.' Waters defended herself on Monday by saying thatRepublicans were trying to 'send a message to all of the white supremacists' by criticizing her call for Black Lives Matter to 'get more confrontational' if Chauvin is found not guilty. Speaking to the Grio, Waters said: 'I am nonviolent.Republicans will jump on any word, any line and try to make it fit their message and their cause for denouncing us and denying us, basically calling us violent. 'Any time they see an opportunity to seize on a word, so they do it and they send a message to the white supremacists, the KKK, the Oath Keepers, the [Proud] Boys and all of that.' She also accused Republicans of using the tactic to raise money off the Democrats' backs. Walters said she was 'not worried that they're going to continue to distort what I say.' 'This is who they are and this is how they act,' she added. 'And I'm not going to be bulled by them.' Chauvin's defense attorney Eric Nelson called for a mistrial on Monday afternoon and cited Rep Maxine Waters' remarks over the weekend that Black Lives Matter Protesters should 'get more confrontational' if the ex-cop is found not guilty. 'I hope we get a verdict that says guilty, guilty, guilty,' Waters said of the Chauvin trial. 'And if we don't, we cannot go away. We've got to stay on the street. We get more active, we've got to get more confrontational. We've got to make sure that they know that we mean business.' Nelson said the comments had the effect of 'threatening and intimidating the jury'. Judge Peter Cahill replied by saying:'I grant you Congresswoman Waters may have handed you grounds for appeal and the turning over of this trial. 'I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case. They should respect a co-equal branch of government.' The judge said that failure to do so was 'abhorrent', but added: 'I don't think it's given additional material with which to prejudice the jury.A congresswoman's opinion really doesn't mean much.' Cahill's condemnation of Waters' comments came after the state of Minnesota concluded its murder case against Chauvin on Monday by telling the jury: 'The reason George Floyd is dead is because Mr Chauvin's heart was too small.' The jury was then dismissed for deliberation, where they will consider three charges against Chauvin: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. After the jury stepped out Nelson called for a mistrial over prosecutor Jerry Blackwell's characterization of the defense's case as 'nonsense' and a 'story' - as well as the possibility that media attention could bias the jury. Judge Cahill said he was not making any findings as to whether Blackwell's comments constituted prosecutorial misconduct that could result in a mistrial but said that he had dealt with all of Nelson's specific objections as he had made them. As for the media attention, Cahill said he is hopeful that the jurors have heeded his warning against looking at any news coverage of the case before officially denying the mistrial motion. Outside the court more than 2,000 National Guard members and 1,100 law enforcement officials stood watch over Minneapolis as the city braces for potential unrest over the verdict. In his closing statement, Nelson insisted that Chauvin acted as any reasonable officer would when he pinned Floyd to the pavement while underlining the handcuffed black man's 'active resistance' to arrest. Nelson urged the jury to examine all of the evidence presented over three weeks of testimony and come to the conclusion that the state did not meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Floyd's death was a direct result of Chauvin's actions on May 25, 2020. 'This was an authorized use of force - as unattractive as that may be,' Nelson said, noting that none of the state's use-of-force experts or police officials could agree on a specific point where Chauvin's actions became unreasonable. He also emphasized the 'hostile' reactions of the crowd that gathered to watch Floyd's arrest and yelled out for the officers to get off of him - asserting that the chaos was distracting for Chauvin. Nelson dragged out his at times rambling closing for more than two hours before Judge Peter Cahill interrupted him and called for a lunch break at 2.10pm local time. When he returned to conclude his statement, Nelson ripped into prosecutors for discounting Floyd's underlying health issues and drug use when arguing that Floyd's primary cause of death was asphyxia during Chauvin's restraint. 'When you take into consideration the presumption of innocence and proof beyond a reason doubt. I would submit to you that it is nonsense to suggest that none of these other factors had any role. That is not reasonable,' Nelson said. 'When you conclude your analysis of the evidence, the entirety of the evidence, when you review the law as written, all within a thorough honest analysis, the state has failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. And therefore Mr Chauvin should be found not guilty of all counts.' Minneapolis was transformed into a fortress over the weekend as city officials, business owners and residents braced for unrest that could follow the verdict in Chauvin's case. More than 3,000 members of the National Guard are currently stationed in the city in addition to 1,100 officers from public safety agencies across the state as part of what has been termed Operation Safety Net. The operation, which is rumored to have cost the city more than $1million, moved into its third stage on Monday with the start of jury deliberation. Nelson began his closing statement by reminding the jury that the Chauvin 'doesn't have to play catch up', he starts with presumption of innocence. For the first time in the case, Chauvin set down the pen with which he has scribbled throughout and looked at the screen on which Nelson displayed definitions of standards of doubt, stretching out his arms and calling for them to consider the scales of justice, reasonably balanced. Civil cases may use a 'preponderance of evidence' as a standard of proof he told them - a grain of sand that could, he suggested, tip the scales. The next level is 'clear and convincing evidence'. This is the standard, Nelson told the jury, that the state used to, 'take away your children.' The highest standard is proof 'beyond a reasonable doubt'. Nelson explained: 'Essentially what the state has to convince you is that the evidence in this case completely eliminates any reasonable doubt – or in other words leaving only unreasonable doubt, capricious, unpredictable, fanciful – space aliens flew in and inhabited the body of Derek Chauvin, that's fanciful.' Nelson asked the jury to be 'intellectually honest' and cast his own statements accordingly. Most notably, Nelson took a quick swipe at the state's rebuttal of defense medical expert Dr David Fowler's contention that carbon monoxide may have played a part in Floyd's death. Dr Tobin came in and told the jury, he said, that there could not have been any carbon monoxide poisoning because his oxygen saturation levels at hospital were 98 percent. Nelson pointed out: 'I could get up in front of you and argue you to that we know this wasn't asphyxiation because George Floyd had a 98 percent oxygen level but that's not intellectually honest. Derek Chauvin's defense has repeatedly suggested that George Floyd may have been experiencing 'excited delirium' during his fatal arrest on May 25. Excited delirium is a condition characterized by the abrupt onset of aggression and distress, typically accompanying drug abuse.  Thomas Lane, a rookie officer who helped restrain Floyd, could be heard on body camera footage questioning whether Floyd might be experiencing excited delirium. The subject came up at Chauvin's trial last week when the defense called Nicole Mackenzie, a Minneapolis police officer who trains other officers in medical care and testified for the prosecution earlier. Mackenzie told the jury that new officers are told how to recognize the signs of excited delirium. Suspects may be incoherent, she said, exhibit extraordinary strength, sweat or suffer from abnormal body temperature, or seem like they suddenly snapped. They're taught that cardiovascular disease, drug abuse or mental illness can trigger excited delirium, she said. But Mackenzie told the jury that she would defer to an emergency room doctor in diagnosing the condition. She also testified that she provides training on excited delirium only to new recruits. Judge Peter Cahill cautioned jurors that there is no evidence that the veteran Chauvin had the training. There is no universally accepted definition of excited delirium and researchers have said it's not well understood. The American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic handbook doesn't list the condition and one study last year concluded it is mostly cited as a cause only when the person who died had been restrained. 'It doesn't stack up against the rest of the evidence because of what we know. We heard the testimony of paramedic Seth Bravinder and [ER physician] Dr Langenfeld. 'They came in and said they began resuscitation efforts, they introduced oxygen they're manually breathing for him. They're re-oxygenating his blood. 'So, when you're looking at the evidence you have to compare it to all of the of the evidence.' If they are missing any single element – even one single element - then, Nelson said, the verdict has to be not guilty. 'I submit to you that the state has failed to meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,' he said. Nelson focused in on the definition of objectively reasonably use of force because, in his words, 'No crime is committed if the police officer's actions were reasonable.' 'You must look at those facts which a reasonable officer in the same situation would have known at the precise moment the officer acted with force,' he said. 'You must decide if the officer's actions were reasonable in light of the totality of the facts and circumstance in front of the officer and without regard to the officer's own state of mind, intention or motivations.' As he did in his opening Nelson cast his net wide when it came to all of the things, he said, an objectively reasonable officer would have been aware of on the day of Floyd's death – the high crime area, the fact that it was high density and urban, the proximity of a hospital, the behavior of the suspect and the unpredictability of humans. A reasonable officer, he said, will take into consideration his immediate surroundings and who he's on the scene with. 'Are these veteran officers, are they rookie officers?' Nelson asked. 'Throughout the course of this trial the state has focused you on nine minutes 29 seconds. The proper analysis is to take those nine minutes 29 seconds and put them in the context of what would a reasonable officer know.' Nelson took the jury through the events of the day; from that moment of the first call to Cup Foods and dispatcher Jenna Scurry's decision to call for back-up. Chauvin and Tou Thao headed to the scene, knowing that there was some sort of disturbance with which the two officers already there - J Alexander Keung and Thomas Lane - were struggling. Nelson showed footage from Lane's body-worn camera of the officers trying to wrangle Floyd into the back of the squad car. 'Active aggression or active resistance?' he asked. 'Let's call it active resistance.' This, Nelson said, was the mental starting point and context upon which Chauvin drew in that moment. Nelson repeatedly stated the notion of 'a reasonable police officer', each time pushing the connection between the concept and his own client. Chauvin, in Nelson's scenario, was that 'reasonable officer' - a characterization that brought in its wake the assumption that the decisions he was making were reasonable. 'He walks onto a scene he's sees active resistance occurring, possibly active aggression. He is not intervening at that time but what are his options?' Nelson asked. 'Distraction techniques, controlled take down, conscious neck restraints – he has, per his training, these techniques at his disposal.' Chauvin did not step in immediately but instead observed, Nelson said before describing what he saw through the perspective of a reasonable officer. A reasonable police officer, Nelson said, would observe the white foam around Floyd's mouth. He would consider the information that this person was possibly on something. A reasonable person would look at the size of a person and assess his size in relation to his own size. A reasonable officer would know that there are two rookies putting Floyd in the car. A reasonable officer would hear what a suspect was saying. 'I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy. I'm claustrophobic,' and he's going to compare those words with the actions of the individual. A reasonable officer, Nelson said, would ask himself, as per training, whether a person is purposefully trying to thwart attempts to take into custody or are they simply unable to comply. A reasonable officer would conclude that the amount of force being used by Keung and Lane was not enough to overpower Floyd's resistance to getting into the car. Nelson quoted the state's own use of force expert, LAPD Sergeant Jody Stiger who had observed the 'futility' of the officers' attempts to get Floyd into the car. The struggle was intense, Nelson reminded – so intense that it knocked the body-worn camera and badge from Chauvin's shirt. Once again the jury saw the milestone camera footage of the scene – the footage that prompted dispatcher Jenna Scurry to report concerns at what she had witnessed to the supervising sergeant. Nelson stopped the video at the moment Floyd was put to the ground and he reminded the jury that there was 'not a single use of force expert [and] not a single police officer [who]said that anything up to this point was unlawful or unreasonable. 'It was reasonable to put him in the squad car, it was reasonable the efforts that they took to restrain him.It's the point at which Mr Floyd is brought to the crowd that there comes dispute.' Derek Chauvin sparked a flurry of social media speculation after he was repeatedly seen scribbling notes on a yellow legal pad over 16 days of testimony at his trial for the death of George Floyd. Eagle-eyed viewers flocked to Twitter to share their theories for what Chauvin was writing in his notebook. One viewer created an entire Twitter account dedicated to the theories, entitled: 'Derek Chauvin's yellow notepad'. Nelson argued that this too was reasonable and in line with training – a move aimed at protecting both the officers and the suspect. He accused the state of trying to 'reframe the issue of what a reasonable police officer would do' by extracting 9 minutes 29 seconds from all that went before. In fact 16 minutes and 59 seconds had gone before – all of which, Nelson said, a reasonable officer would consider. 'A reasonable police officer would know about those previous 17 minutes, he would know about the struggle, he would consider the suspects reaction to the previous use of force. 'And a reasonable police officer would consider using an additional force to overcome the subject's resistance.' Nelson told the court: 'I have thought a lot about the difference between perspective and perception. Perspective is the angle at which you see something, perception is how you interpret what it is that you see. 'I've thought about this a lot because it's not the normal set up for a jury trial. Icannot see four of the jurors. They probably can't see me either. Several of the jurors I have a very good view of, four of them I do not, others it's obstructed. 'Things can affect your perspective. But your perception is how you interpret what you see and that's our life, our experiences the things that make us what we are.' As far as the jury is concerned, Nelson said: 'Ultimately the court will instruct you on how to deal with these biases.The court's final instructions will guide you to try to recognize your biases, what we bring to the table and analyze the evidence from the perspective of the incident itself.' The witnesses on the scene did not have the benefit of such reflection or instruction, Nelson said. They brought their own biases to the table and each impacted on what they believed they saw and how they reacted to it. Nelson spoke of Charles McMillan, who urged Floyd to get in the car and left the scene wishing Chauvin to 'get home safe.' He spoke of Darnella Frazier, the 17-year-old who filmed the incident – but did not even know officers Lane and Keung were there. And Donald Williams, the MMA fighter who accused Chauvin of putting Floyd in a blood choke - but both carotid articles were never blocked, Nelson told the court. 'This was not a choke hold.' Speaking of Williams Nelson said: 'He was upset and that's okay because his perception affected what he was seeing.' Similarly, he suggested that off-duty fire-fighter Genevieve Hansen was almost overwhelmed by her perceptions. Nelson pointed out that she admitted the crowd distracted her from focusing on the officers, she interpreted fluid on the ground as Floyd's urine and assumed the blood on his face was from the ground. When told in court that EMS had been called five minutes before she arrived she flat out refused to believe what was, in fact, a verifiable truth. 'What she observed was not consistent with the actual evidence,' Nelson said. Meanwhile the officers on the scene were, he said, all aware that they were being filmed and Chauvin was making his assessment of the situation minute by minute attempting to keep control of both Floyd and the crowd which, Nelson said, he would have recognized was in crisis. According to Nelson the most critical moment in the case came at 8.25.16pm.At that moment three things happened: Floyd took his last breath, Chauvin pulled his mace and threatened the crowd with it and Hansen entered the scene walking up behind the officers and startling him. All of these events happened at once and influenced Chauvin's perception he said. All of these things conspired to form Chauvin's perception of threat and, referencing the testimony of Medical Support Coordinator Nicole MacKenzie, created a situation in which it was more easy to miss something with Floyd. Nelson pointed out that paramedics did a 'load and go' after assessing the crowd as 'unfriendly'. He listed all of officers who testified about Chauvin's use of force, reeling off their names and stating that they all came to different conclusions as to when use of force became unnecessary. Nelson said that a witness he found particularly interesting was Lieutenant Johnny Mercil as he was Chauvin's actual use of force trainer so, Nelson said, 'the best glimpse we're going to get into the training of a Minneapolis police officer'. 'He corrected the state at times,' Nelson said of Mercil. 'He said the knee on the neck is not an unauthorized move and can be utilized. He said it can be there for an extended period of time [and that] once a person is handcuffed people can continue to thrash around and be a danger to themselves and others. Nelson reminded the jury that Mercil had testified about ground defense and using weight to control a suspect and how he said that there were no strict techniques, that he personally trains officers to put a knee over the shoulder, up to the base of the neck and described it as routinely used. Mercil, Nelson said, recognized the concept of 'awful but lawful'. And admitted that there are circumstances under which an assessment had to be made as to whether or not it was worth the risk to handcuff a person and administer medical aid. And he recognized the human element – the impact of use of force on the officer doing it. 'You have to take into account that officers are human beings capable of making mistakes,' he said. 'In this case the totality of the circumstances as known to a reasonable officer in the precise moment the force was used demonstrate this was an authorized use of force, as unattractive as it may be and this is reasonable doubt.' In a moment of marked emotion amid a clinical assessment of all that had occurred, Nelson said: 'There is absolutely no evidence that officer Chauvin purposefully applied unlawful force. 'Officer Chauvin did not purposefully use unlawful force. These are officers doing their job in a highly stressful situation according to their training according to the Minneapolis police department.It's tragic. It's tragic.' Turning to cause of death, Nelson once again apologized for being long-winded but said that there was an important sentence that the state had not read to the jury. Reading the instruction handed to the jury earlier, Nelson emphasized the key qualification that the state had omitted: 'The defendant is criminally liable for all the consequences of his actions that occur in the ordinary and natural course of events, including those consequences brought about by one or more intervening causes if such intervening causes were the natural result of the defendant's acts.' The reason the state was seeking to convince the jury that asphyxia was the sole cause of Floyd's death was, Nelson said, because none of the other contributing factors – heart disease, hypertension, excited delirium, fentanyl and amphetamine ingestion - were natural consequences of Chauvin's actions. Instead, they were consequences of Floyd's own. He said: 'The state [has] to convince you beyond a reasonable doubt that there pre-existing issues did not contribute to Mr Floyd's death. 'That is why the state has brought in expert after expert after expert to testify that the single cause of death was asphyxiation.' Viewed as a whole, according to Nelson, testimony from the state's experts witnesses 'flies in the face of common sense', especially when set against Dr Andrew Baker's findings. The Chief Medical Examiner said there was no evidence of asphyxia at autopsy. Nelson gave as examples that there were no fine bruises he would expect to see. There were no injuries to the structures of Floyd's neck and when he finally did review the video which he had avoided watching ahead of the autopsy so that he would not bias himself, he saw nothing about the placement of Chauvin's knee to change his opinion. And all of the other physical defects he found Nelson said – the enlarged heart, the narrowed arteries, the paraganglioma – were the findings relied upon by all other experts who, he suggested, willfully ignored things that did not fit the narrative of asphyxia. Dr Baker found the manner of death was homicide but in a medical not criminal sense. In his official finding he wrote, 'Cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression' Dr Baker explained that he used the word 'complicating' to mean, 'an intervention occurred and there was an untoward outcome on the heels of that intervention.' He also told the court that if he wrote something on the death certificate he did so for the simple reason that it played a role in the death. He added arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease; fentanyl intoxication and recent use of amphetamine.' Nelson said, 'Apparently the state did not like Dr Baker's findings. His findings didn't support the notion that what you see is what you should believe.' Nelson tackled some of Dr Martin Tobin's most emotive testimony, that he termed the 'finger and knuckle testimony,' the doctor's view that Floyd used both to push himself up so that he could breathe. According to Nelson this testimony falls apart when viewed through the prism of the facts and detached from the doctor's own bias. The time stamp on the images used to highlight the theory shows that Floyd was actually in the side recovery position at the time – just 15 minutes into his restraint. He would continue to breathe for another five minutes and 51 seconds. Nelson said, 'This illustrates how you can take a nanosecond of time in this address, have this testimony that he's pushing his body up to try to breathe, but when you look at the evidence compared to the rest of the evidence what do you really see? 'You see a person on his side being held in the side recovery position, his fingers and knuckles occasionally touching the ground and tire.' Nelson warned the jury, 'You cannot take a single isolated frame and reach any conclusions.' Again and again Nelson returned to his theme – that nothing in this case could be viewed in isolation but that instead everything must be placed in the context of the totality of circumstances. He urged the jury, 'Put the evidence in its proper context.' Cause of death, Nelson told them, 'is a multifactorial process.' The history of Floyd's use of illegal substances was significant, Nelson said and not a character attack. IT provided insight on how his body might react to opioid use within the context of a law enforcement encounter. Nelson reminded the jurors that Floyd's girlfriend Courtney Ross had admitted that both struggled with opioid addiction. He remined them of the prior arrest on May 6, 2019 when Floyd had a remarkably similar encounter with police that resulted in his blood pressure skyrocket to 216 to 160. He reminded them of Ross's testimony that Floyd had suffered an accidental overdose and complained that his 'whole body hurt' at the time. He reminded them of the 'knock off' pills purchased by Floyd from his friend Morries Hall and how they made Ross feel as if she was going to die when she took them. Hall, Nelson pointed out, was with Floyd on May 25, 2020. He told them about store clerk Christopher Martin's observation that Floyd was high and Shawanda Hill's testimony that he fell asleep back in the car and they couldn't keep him awake. Nelson said it was 'a preposterous notion' that the amount of fentanyl in Floyd's system did not play some part in his death. Continuing his lengthy closing after a brief lunch break, Nelson told the jury that the state was asking them to simply ignore 'significant medical issues' when they offered up asphyxia as the sole cause of Floyd's death. 'The failure of the state's experts to acknowledge any possibility that any of these factors in any way contributed defies medical silence and it defies common sense and reason,' he said. Applying common sense and reason to the timeline of Floyd's last verbalizations, Nelson told the court that it was consistent with the 'sudden cardiac arrhythmia' and not 'the long prognosis of hypoxia', or low oxygen. Nelson also cleared up an aspersion cast on Dr Fowler's evidence during cross examination when Jerry Blackwell challenged the doctor that he didn't even know if the squad car was running, as he knocked down Foster's assertion that carbon monoxide from the tail pipe may have contributed to Floyd's death. Today Nelson said: 'We know it was running' and pointed to officer Lane's body-camera footage, which showed he never turned off the car when arriving at the scene. Nelson pondered what would have happened if the paramedics had treated on the scene or gone straight to the hospital rather than drive a few blocks away. Might Floyd have been revived? His point was, he said, 'Human beings make decisions in highly stressful situations that they believe to be right in the very moment that it is occurring. There's lots of what ifs? What could have happened? What should have happened? Lots of them in lots of regards. 'But we have to analyze this case from the perspective of a reasonable police officer in the precise moment of use of force. 'We have to look at cause of death. Did Mr Floyd die of asphyxia or were there other contributory factors that were not the natural consequence of Mr Chauvin's action? 'The drug ingestion, the diseased heart, the hypertension – all of these things existed before Mr Chauvin arrived.' 'The struggle,' he said, 'What role did the struggle play?We know in a prior incident Mr Floyd's heart was beating at 219 over 160. He didn't die that day.' Wrapping up closing statement that had taken close to three hours, Nelson once again asserted that the state had failed to prove Chauvin guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and thus the jury should not find him guilty on any charge. Trial attorney Jerry Blackwell then stood to deliver the state's rebuttal. He told the jury that while they had heard 45 witness in all, there was a 46th – one that spoke to them before the trial, during it and would continue to speak to them in the deliberations room: common sense. For all the issues brought up in closing statements Blackwell told the jury, 'the case is so simple a child could understand it'. In fact, a child had, he said referencing nine-year-old witness Judea who had said that she thought a remedy might have been to 'get off of him'. Blackwell painted Nelson's closing summary as a 'story' because 'it's either completely not true or the facts have been altered in order to make a point to you, which makes it a story. 'You've got to reach a verdict – verdict's a Latin word for truth. You're not reaching a story.' Picking up on Nelson's technique of repeatedly casting Chauvin in the role of 'a reasonable officer', Blackwell said: 'Reasonable officer is not a magic word that you apply to Mr Chauvin and then he becomes one. 'The whole narrative cut off before we got to the point that Mr Floyd was not moving, not conscious, did not have a pulse and that Mr Chauvin is still on top of him when the EMTs showed up. How is that reasonable?' With characteristic savagery Blackwell dismantled Nelson's assertion that Floyd died from causes other than Chauvin's actions. 'The notion that Mr Floyd dying was just coincidental, he just happened to die in the same time and same place of factors unrelated to what Mr Chauvin was doing – that's a story ladies and gentlemen and defies common sense,' Blackwell said. Floyd had lived 17,026 days, Blackwell said, many with all of the underlying problems that Nelson flagged up, he had survived everything but his encounter with Chauvin. Where Nelson had suggested that the state's expert witnesses differed in their opinions, Blackwell said they were united in one key fact: 'There was a use of force that set a number of things in motion for Mr Floyd that culminated in his death.' He reminded them that Dr Tobin had said that no human being could have survived the restrained and neck compression to which Floyd was subjected. 'We are only required to show you that Mr Chauvin's conduct was a substantial cause in Mr Floyd's death,' Blackwell said. And, however their experts may have differed in the precise mechanisms involved, he said they all agreed that Floyd's death stemmed back to the subdual, restraint and neck compression. He rejected the suggestion that there are two sides to every story – a premise on which Nelson has repeatedly fallen back. The court is not about 'stories', Blackwell said, 'What we're about here is getting to the truth.' In a similar vein he said that the police badge which Chauvin wore was 'not a license to abuse the public, to not follow procedures'. There are no two sides to that, he said, 'that's simply wrong and the only sides to that are the 'w' and the 'g' [of wrong].' Chauvin 'had all the power', that day, Blackwell said – 'He had a gun, he had mace, he had back up.' And the crowd that he was facing, Blackwell said, consisted of three high school juniors, a second-grader, a senior taking her cousin to get candy, Donald Williams the MMA fighter who wanted to save Floyd's life, Charles McMillan – 'the mayor' of the neighborhood and Genevieve Hansen. This 'bouquet of humanity', all of different ages, races and genders did not present any threat, Blackwell said, 'They came together, they saw a human being they did not know suffering and they wanted to intervene.' Had they wanted to take the law into their own hands, Blackwell told the court, they could have removed Chauvin but they respected the badge. As he repeatedly characterized all that the defense had said about the crowd and events of that day as 'a story' Nelson objected in a move that was sustained by the judge who told Blackwell to move on from the use of the word. The state's closing: Prosecutors tell jurors to ask whether Floyd would have died were it not for Chauvin's restraint In closing for the state, prosecutor Steve Schleicher asked the jury to consider one question in coming to a verdict: Would Floyd have died were it not for the cop's restraint? Schleicher posed the question as he sought to cast doubt on the myriad of factors the defense presented as contributing causes of Floyd's death, including his drug use, heart problems and potential exposure to exhaust from the squad car he was pinned next to on May 25. 'The defendant knew better. He just didn't do better,' Schleicher said of Chauvin. 'George Floyd did not have to die that day, should not have died that day. But, for the fact that the defendant decided not to get up, and not to let up, George Floyd died.' Schleicher also refuted the defense suggestion that Floyd had 'superhuman strength' during his arrest because he was suffering from 'excited delirium'. Floyd was 'a human being,' the prosecutor said. 'There is no such thing as super human, that exists in comic books.' Underlining how hard Floyd fought just to be able to breathe, Schleicher showed the court graphic photos of the injuries he suffered when he was pinned down, which had been previously presented to the jury but were not released publicly until Monday. As he did throughout three weeks of testimony, Chauvin sat silent and expressionless and took notes on a yellow legal pad as Schleicher walked the jury through each of the charges he's facing: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Schleicher asserted that Floyd died because Chauvin's 'ego and pride' took over and caused the cop to betray his badge and abandon his training when he pressed his knee into the handcuffed black man's neck. 'All that was required [to save Floyd] was some compassion,' Schleicher told the court. But instead Floyd was crushed beneath the knee of the officer, surrounded by strangers with no familiar face or loved one to cry out to. Schleicher noted that Floyd's final words were addressed to Chauvin: 'I can't breathe', over and over. 'But he continued to hold him down, to grind into him, to shimmy,' Schleicher said. 'George Floyd begged until he could speak no more and the defendant continued this assault. 'The truth is the defendant was on top of him for nine minutes and 29 seconds and he had to know.' Schleicher opened his statement by telling the jury who Floyd was – that he was born on October 14, 1973, in Fayetteville, North Carolina, that he was a 'mama's boy', a beloved son, brother and father. And Schleicher bookended Floyd's life – loved and surrounded by loved ones – with his death, ground into the asphalt and alone. Addressing the fact that it is hard to believe that a police officer could 'do something like this,' Schleicher told the court this is not a case against the police, but against one particular bad cop. What the defendant did, he said, 'wasn't policing. It was assault'. 'It was unnecessary, it was gratuitous and he did it on purpose,' Schleicher told the jury. 'He betrayed the badge and everything he stood for. [He] abandoned his values, abandoned his training and killed a man'. Chauvin was responding to a call over a fake $20 bill but, the prosecutor told the silent court, 'George Floyd's life was taken for something worth far, far less than that.' Floyd died because Chauvin was 'trying to win' and because of Chauvin's 'ego and pride', Schleicher said.  It was not, he said, 'the kind of pride that makes you do better'. It was, 'The kind of ego-based pride that the defendant was going to do what he wanted to do as long as he wanted because he had the authority and he had the power and of the badge…[he was] trying to win and George Floyd paid for it with his life.' According to Schleicher, Chauvin 'chose pride over policing'. Schleicher took the jury back through the events of May 25 and told them all of the reasons a person might be unable to comply to police commands - all of the reasons taught in the crisis response training undertaken by all of the officers there that day. 'It's nothing new,' he told the jury. 'People have emotions. People don't meet the police on their best day very often.' He reminded them of Chief Medaria Arradondo's testimony that MPD responds to 4,000 calls for service for people in crisis every year. 'They're there on a $20 counterfeiting charge,' he said. 'They train for this.' Schleicher did not attempt to sugar coat Floyd's issues. He 'certainty had his struggles,' the prosecutor said, referencing testimony from Floyd's girlfriend Courteney Ross about his struggles with opioid addiction. That was nothing new for officers either, Schleicher said. 'The difference on May 25, 2020 is that officers wouldn't listen to him, wouldn't recognize the signs of what they had prepared for,' he said. 'A reasonable officer should have known that and recognized that. Floyd was trying to get into the car. He was trying to work up the courage. He said he'd count to three but he just couldn't do it.' Everything that happened that day was, the prosecutor said, 'completely unnecessary', but the excessive force started in earnest the moment the officers had Floyd prone and handcuffed on the ground. Schleicher told jurors to ask themselves if Floyd would have died were it not for what Chauvin did that day. Was it his enlarged heart, did he suddenly die of a drug overdose, was it the fumes from the car tail-pipe? 'Use your common sense,' Schleicher urged. 'Believe your eyes. What you saw you was murder.' Turning to the law as Judge Cahill had instructed the jurors, Schleicher reminded: 'The fact that other causes contribute to the death does not relieve the defendant of criminal liability.' The only scenario in which Chauvin is not criminally liable if a 'superseding cause' caused his death. But, Schleicher intimated, 'The unlawful restraint…that's what killed George Floyd. Believe your eyes. Unlawful force pinning him to the ground, that's what killed him. That was a homicide.' Schleicher guided the jury back through the experts they had heard and the testimony they had given – including emergency room physician Dr Bradford Langenfeld, Chief Medical Examiner Dr Andrew Baker, who ruled the death a homicide, and pulmonologist Dr Martin Tobin. Those experts explained both what Floyd did and did not die from, Schleicher said. 'You know how George Floyd died,' the prosecutor said, harking back to Dr Tobin's testimony during which he said that Floyd had been held 'in a vice' between the pavement and Chauvin's knee. 'He said it was as if George Floyd's left lung had been surgically removed to the point where Mr Floyd was desperately trying to breathe, pushing his shoulder, pushing his face [against the ground] to breathe.' 'That's what killed Mr Floyd.'This wasn't a sudden arrhythmia, the prosecutor insisted, there was no medical evidence of a heart attack and it wasn't a drug overdose. 'George Floyd was obviously not a perfect man. Who is? No-one is. You heard about drugs, you heard about questions: 'Is he chewing gum, does he have a pill in his mouth?'None of that matters because you know what his drug level was from the toxicology result,' Schleicher said. He went on to refute the suggestion that Floyd was experiencing 'Excited Delirium', and said the idea that the condition gave him 'super-human strength' or made him 'impervious to pain' was 'nonsense'. There were so may things that might have saved Floyd's life, Schleicher said; putting Floyd in the side recovery position or keeping him in it in the first place or giving immediate medical aid in the form of CPR chest compressions. 'These actions were not policing, theses actions were an assault,' he said. As for whether Chauvin was acting knowingly or not, Schleicher said: 'It's pretty simple. You're doing something to hurt somebody and you keep doing it. You're doing it on purpose.' Schleicher played excerpts of the officers' body-worn camera footage showing Floyd prone and handcuffed beneath them. 'Do you want to know what indifference looks like?' he asked, before playing a portion in which Chauvin can be heard responding to Floyd's pleas of 'you're killing me,' and complaints that his stomach hurts, that everything hurts with the sound: 'Uh Huh'before adding: 'It takes a lot of oxygen to complain about it.' Schleicher told the court: 'That isn't protection. It isn't courage and it certainly, certainly isn't compassion. It's the opposite of that.' But Chauvin's negligence goes beyond what he did and extended towards what he did not do, Schleicher said. Despite the fact that Chauvin had the 'knowledge and tools' he did not render medical aid. In all, Schleicher concluded that the only possible verdict on all three counts was guilty. But even after that he said: 'You have another thing to consider. Was this just okay because the defendant was a police officer? Was it justified? Was this objectively reasonable?' He told the jury: 'It was not.' 'We talked a lot about what might have happened, hypotheticals. We talked a lot about what didn't happen. You need to focus on what did happen.George Floyd wasn't resisting, he just couldn't comply. They do it all the time. 'He wasn't going anywhere. He was doing anything. He didn't need to be put in a prone position, but the defendant was on top of him he stayed on top of him, grinding his knee on him, twisting his wrist - simply the infliction of pain not a reasonable use of force. Force must be reasonable at the point it occurs, the point it ends and all points in between.' 'Don't miss the forest for the trees,' he urged the jury. 'Officer after officer, the Chief of Police, got on that stand and told you that this conduct violates the use of force policy, the department's core values, the duty of care. 'When George Floyd said his final words to the defendant the defendant stayed on top of him. He ignored it. Continued doing what he was doing. Facing the crowd, grinding his knee, twisting his hand.' 'The greatest sceptic of the case among you, how can you justify the continued use of force on this man when he has no pulse.It wasn't too late. He could have rolled him over and performed CPR. 'He continued past the point of finding a pulse, past the point where the ambulance arrived, past the point where the paramedics got out. What's the goal? What are we trying to accomplish here? Why hold him so long, past that line that was crossed?' Schleicher let the words pile up – unreasonable, unnecessary, unlawful. 'The defendant is guilty of second-degree murder. He's guilty of third-degree murder and he's guilty of second-degree manslaughter: all of them,' he said. 'This is not a justified used of force. You can't justify this use of force it's not possible.' Schleicher returned to his opening sentiments as he wound towards the end of his powerful two-hour closing statement. He had said at the start that Floyd had died surrounded by strangers but they were not, he said people who did not care. 'They all converged by fate in one single moment of time to witness something,' he said. 'To witness nine minutes 29 seconds of shocking abuse of authority, to watch a man die and there was nothing they could do about it because they were powerless. Because even they respected the badge. Even seeing this happening. 'All they could do was watch and gather what they could, gather their memories, their thoughts and impressions, those precious recordings and they gathered those up and they brought them here and they got up on the stand and they bore witness to this outrageous act and they gave you what they had.' 'And they gave it to you,' he said looking at the jury, 'Randomly selected people from the community. You got a summons in the mail and here you are – all converged on one spot. 'That power belongs to you. Only you have the power to convict the defendant of this crime and in so doing declare that this use of force was unreasonable it was excessive, it was grossly disproportionate. 'It is not an excuse for the shocking abuse you saw with your own eye.This case is exactly what you thought when you saw hit first.' Returning to Jerry Blackwell's opening statements as he wrapped up his own closing, Schleicher said: 'You can believe your eyes. It's exactly what you knew it was. It's what you felt in your gut. It's what you now know in your heart. 'This wasn't policing, this was murder. The defendant is guilty on all three counts – all of them – there no excuse.' Before closing statements Judge Peter Cahill addressed the jury and told them to stick to the evidence presented in court when coming to a verdict. 'It is your duty to decide the questions of fact. It is my duty to give you the rules of law that apply,' the judge said. 'You must follow the law even if you believe the law is or should be different.' Judge Cahill said that 'beyond reasonable doubt' is the standard upon which an 'ordinary prudent man or woman would act in their ordinary affairs.' Reasonable doubt, he told them, is a doubt, 'based on common sense.' It is not 'a fanciful or capricious doubt nor is it beyond all doubt.' He talked them through the law as it applies to each of the three counts faced by Chauvin. None of the charges – second-degree murder, third-degree murder or second-degree manslaughter – require the jury to find that Chauvin intended to cause substantial bodily harm or the death of George Floyd. Even the most serious count only requires them to find that he committed the act of felony assault and does not need the additional element of any intention to cause the harm that it did. Put bluntly it would be enough for them to find that he did it. Equally they may find him guilty of causing Floyd's death if they decide that his act or acts were a substantial factor in Floyd's death. They need not be the only factor if the jury but any others must be a direct result of Chauvin's act. But if they decide that there was another superseding cause that was not a result of Chauvin's acts. All of their assessments of Chauvin must be considered through the prism of whether his use of force was 'objectively reasonable in light of the totality of the facts without regard to the officer's own intentions.' Chauvin is not guilty, he told them, if they find that the force he used was authorized by law. The state's case: Prosecutors called 38 witnesses - including police officials, medical experts and people who watched Floyd's fatal arrest in real time - to prove the black man's death caused by Chauvin's actions Chauvin's highly anticipated trial began on March 29 with an opening statement from trial attorney Jerry Blackwell, who vowed to prove that the defendant 'betrayed the badge' when he 'did not get up, did not let up' for nine minutes and 29 seconds, even after Floyd stopped breathing and despite the fevered pleas from bystanders for him to release Floyd. Second-degree murder Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, which in Minnesota can be 'intentional' or 'unintentional.'The second-degree murder charge requires prosecutors to prove Chauvin caused Floyd's death while committing or trying to commit a felony — in this case, third-degree assault. Prosecutors must convince the jury that Chauvin assaulted or attempted to assault Floyd and in doing so inflicted substantial bodily harm.Prosecutors don't have to prove Chauvin was the sole cause of Floyd's death - only that his conduct was a 'substantial causal factor.'If the prosecution can prove Chauvin committed third-degree assault , he can be convicted of Floyd's death. Prosecutors are fearful that Chauvin will escape conviction for second-degree murder, that carries a maximum 40 year sentence.But because Chauvin does not have any prior convictions, sentencing guidelines recommend he serve no more than 25.5 years in jail. Second-degree manslaughter The manslaughter charge has a lower bar, requiring proof Chauvin caused Floyd's death through negligence that created an unreasonable risk, and consciously took the chance of causing severe injury or death. If convicted of second-degree manslaughter in Minnesota, the charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.But sentencing guidelines for someone without a criminal record call for no more than four years behind bars. Third-degree murder Third-degree murder would require a lower standard of proof than second-degree.To win a conviction, prosecutors would have to show only that Floyd's death was caused by an act that was obviously dangerous, though not necessarily a felony. That would result in a maximum sentence of 25 years. But there are caveats. Chauvin has no criminal history, which means he will likely end up serving about 12.5 years if he is convicted of second or third-degree murder. Over the next 11 days prosecutors brought in 38 witnesses - beginning with people who watched Floyd's fatal arrest unfold in real time. Among them was 911 dispatcher Jena Scurry, who called the officers' supervisor with concerns about their use of force; off-duty firefighter and EMT Genevieve Hansen, who begged the officers to allow her to provide medical aid; nine-year-old Judea and her cousin Darnella Frazier, who filmed the most famous viral video of the arrest; and mixed martial arts fighter Don Williams, who testified that Chauvin used a 'blood choke' on Floyd. Christopher Martin, the Cup Foods employee whose concerns about a counterfeit $20 bill Floyd used to buy cigarettes led to his arrest, also testified that he wished he hadn't said anything because he believes Floyd might still be alive today if he'd kept quiet. During testimony from these eye-witnesses the jury was shown several graphic videos of Floyd's confrontation with police. Prosecutors also showed video of Floyd inside the Cup Foods store before police were called, in which he appeared agitated, distracted and potentially under the influence of drugs. The second week of the trial was dominated by technical testimony, beginning with senior Minneapolis Police Department officials, including Chief Medaria Arradondo, who testified that Chauvin violated department policy when he restrained Floyd for nine minutes and 29 seconds. Police officials testified that while officers might sometimes use a knee across a person's back or shoulder to gain or maintain control, they're also taught the specific dangers for a person in Floyd's position - prone on his stomach, with his hands cuffed behind him - and how such a person must be turned into a side recovery position as soon as possible. Later in the prosecutors called a string of medical experts to testify that Floyd died due to a lack of oxygen, not from a primary cardiac event. Some of the most powerful testimony came from Dr Martin Tobin, a lung and critical care specialist who told jurors that other factors, not just Chauvin's knee, made it hard for Floyd to breathe: officers lifting up his handcuffs, the hard pavement, his turned head and a knee on his back. Tobin pinpointed the moment when he said he could see Floyd take his last breath - and said Chauvin's knee remained on Floyd's neck another 3 minutes, two seconds.'At the beginning, you can see he's conscious, you can see slight flickering, and then it disappears,' Tobin said as he highlighted a still image from police body-camera video. 'That's the moment the life goes out of his body.' The state rested its case on April 13, at which point all eyes turned to Chauvin's attorney Nelson. The defense case: Chauvin's attorneys called just seven witnesses to shift blame away from the ex-cop and onto Floyd's drug use and health problems At the center of Nelson's defense was the argument that Floyd's death was not caused by Chauvin's actions but by outside factors - namely Floyd's drug addiction and underlying health conditions, including a bad heart. Nelson made two other key arguments: that use of force is an unattractive but essential component of policing, and that the hostile crowd that surrounded Chauvin and fellow officers as they restrained Floyd had distracted them from proper procedure and care. Nelson called just seven witnesses over two days of testimony. He began by showing the jury video from Floyd's arrest on May 6, 2019, in an effort to portray that he had a history of feigning medical distress and rapidly ingesting pills when confronted by police through testimony by an officer and a paramedic involved in that arrest. The next two witnesses - Minneapolis Park Police Officer Peter Chang and Floyd's friend Shawanda Hill - spoke about what they saw on the day of Floyds death as the court was shown new body-camera footage of the chaos. The sixth witness was Barry Brodd, a former cop and use-of-force expert who testified that Chauvin did not use deadly force against Floyd.In fact, Brodd argued that Chauvin's placing the handcuffed black man in the prone position and kneeling on his neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds did not constitute use of force at all. 'It's a control technique. It doesn't hurt,' Brodd said. 'It's safe for the officer, safe for the suspect and you're using minimal effort to keep them on the ground.' During direct examination by Nelson, Brodd said Chauvin was 'justified' and acting 'with objective reasonableness' in his interactions with Floyd. He also leaned in to the defense narrative that Chauvin and his fellow officers felt 'threatened' by the gathering crowd. But as he looked at the all-too-familiar image of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck under cross-examination, Brodd was forced to concede that such a restraint would cause pain and thus also 'could be use of force'. The final and perhaps most influential witness called was Dr David Fowler, a former chief medical examiner in Maryland who shared his conclusion that Floyd's death should have never been classified as a homicide because there were too many competing potential causes of death. One of the potential causes Fowler presented was exposure to exhaust fumes from the squad car Floyd was pinned next to, which the defense witness said could have caused some degree of carbon monoxide poisoning. The carbon monoxide point was one of many on which Fowler contradicted the opinions of medical experts who testified before him.Blackwell drilled down on those contradictions while attempting to chip away at Fowler's credibility during cross-examination, at one point telling him: 'You're not a toxicologist..a pulmonologist.. a cardiologist, a physiologist…You don't treat patients.' Fowler's earliest contradiction over more than five hours of testimony on April 14 came when he shared his conclusion that Floyd died from a 'sudden cardiac arrhythmia' due to his underlying heart disease during his restraint by police. That conclusion was refuted by Dr Baker, the Hennepin County chief medical examinerwho performed Floyd's autopsy. Fowler also said that Floyd had an enlarged heart, which meant he needed more oxygen to function, and that methamphetamine use heightened his risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Later in his lengthy and technical testimony, Fowler cited multiple studies which challenged the notion that the prone position - in which Floyd was held for nine minutes and 29 seconds - is inherently dangerous. He also referenced studies which concluded that it doesn't matter how much a person weighs if they are applying a single knee to another person - and a double knee restraint makes only a modest difference. According to those studies a person transfers just 23 percent of their bodyweight during a double knee restraint. So, Dr Fowler said, Chauvin – who he viewed as applying a single knee restraint for most of the restraint – would have been applying less than 30 to 35 pounds of weight to Floyd. Fowler asserted that none of that weight compromised Floyd's 'vital neck structures', that there was no evidence of injury to Floyd's neck and that the pressure applied was less than the amount necessary to bruise him. Moments before the defense rested Chauvin addressed the court for the first time on the morning of April 15 and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination, meaning he would not take the stand. In a brief rebuttal later that morning the prosecution recalled Dr Tobin to refute Fowler's claims about the potential for carbon monoxide poisoning, with which Tobin said he disagreed entirely. Judge Cahill barred Tobin from referring to specific test results with Floyd's carbon monoxide levels, which the prosecution sought to enter into evidence just minutes earlier. But Tobin told the court Floyd's hemoglobin was 98 percent saturated with oxygen, leaving up to two percent for carbon monoxide.Pressing that point Tobin told the jury: 'You and I have somewhere between zero and three.' Judge Cahill excused the jurors through the weekend, reminding them to pack a bag ahead of sequestration on Monday following closing statements.",News,4/20/2021
Biden administration plans to limit nicotine levels so that cigarettes are LESS addictive,"The Biden administration is considering requiring tobacco companies to reduce the nicotine levels of cigarettes sold in the U.S. to make them less addictive. Public officials are rapidly approaching a deadline on which they need to decide whether menthol cigarettes will be banned for sale, and a cap on nicotine levels could be announced at the same time. A decision will need to be made by April 29. Menthol cigarettes have long been considered a gateway product for younger smokers. The 2009 Tobacco Control Act banned candy, fruit and spice flavorings in cigarettes because of their potential appeal to children, but did not deal with menthol. The administration is now weighing whether to adjust nicotine levels at the same time as a menthol ban or introduce it as a separate policy, according to the Wall Street Journal. Although nicotine doesn't cause cancer, it does make smoking more addictive. Smoking has been linked to 480,000 deaths in the US annually. The idea behind reducing levels of nicotine would be to make the cigarettes less addictive and perhaps encourage smokers to quit or move to other safer products. 'Any action that the FDA takes must be based on science and evidence and must consider the real-world consequences of such actions, including the growth of an illicit market and the impact on hundreds of thousands of jobs from the farm to local stores across the country,' Altria spokesperson George Parman told CNBC . Stocks in tobacco plummeted on the news Monday. 'Many consumers wrongly believe that a cigarette very low in nicotine content is lower in risk than traditional cigarettes, a misconception that poses a major hurdle in determining proposed rulemaking for low nicotine cigarettes,' Reynolds American spokesperson Kaelan Hollon said. A spokeswoman for Reynolds American Inc. said that the data available on nicotine reduction is inconclusive and said 'there are better tools for improving public health', according to the Wall Street Journal. However, research has shown that smokers are more likely to quit cigarettes or switch to e-cigarettes or gums when nicotine is reduced, the Journal reported. Nicotine can be reduced in cigarettes by either genetically modifying tobacco plants or removing nicotine from the tobacco leaf during manufacturing. Menthol is a compound that is found in mint plants and has been added to cigarettes since the 1920s.",News,4/20/2021
Biden bans ICE and Customs and Border Protection from using 'illegal aliens' to describe migrants and tells them to use 'integration' instead of 'assimilation',"President Joe Biden's administration may still be detaining undocumented immigrants at the southern border – but it will no longer be locking up illegal aliens, under a new policy circumscribing the language border officials can use. Immigration enforcement officials will stop using the term 'alien, 'illegal aliens' and 'assimilation' altogether, under a new memo from top Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officials. Instead, they will use language the administration says is more humanizing, even as the administration confronts a wave of attempted crossings at the southern border. 'As the nation's premier law enforcement agency, we set a tone and example for our country and partners across the world,' wrote Troy Miller of CBP, in a memo obtained by the Washington Post. 'We enforce our nation's laws while also maintaining the dignity of every individual with whom we interact. The words we use matter and will serve to further confer that dignity to those in our custody.' Instead of 'assimilation,' authorities will use 'integration.' The word of choice for those without legal authorization will be 'undocumented' – a term long preferred by immigration advocates. Miller is the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Commissioner for CBP, and oversees the organization's 60,000 employees. The head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement – an agency some critics called for banning during the Trump administration – also issued a memo directing changes. 'In response to the vision set by the Administration, ICE will ensure agency communications use the preferred terminology and inclusive language.' saidTae Johnson wrote in a memo. The term 'alien' has occurred in official government documents for years. A July 2020 Trump Administration executive order was titled 'Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census,' and was designed to exclude them from the count for Congress. One recent tweet by Miller of CBP sought to put border agents who first interact with would-be migrants crossing the border in a better light. 'Border Patrol agents have RESCUED more than 4,600 individuals along the Southwest border in the last six months. @CBP agents and officers stand ready to provide lifesaving assistance to all who need it,' he wrote. He also retweeted a border agent in San Diego who sent out an image of agents who 'rescued an injured & lost migrant woman Sunday.' Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among a small group of House Democrats who called to 'abolish ICE' in 2018. The change in tone comes after Biden reversed course after saying a 15,000 person cap on refugees for the current fiscal year was justified. Biden soon afterward said more refugees would be allowed, and the White House on Monday denied a flip flop.

Bari Weiss slams her former employer The New York Times and The Washington Post for 'ignoring the ideological takeover of schools' because they too have been 'transformed' by woke culture ,"Former New York Times editor Bari Weiss has accused her previous employer of being too 'woke' to cover the growing row about New York City's private schools, after a teacher and a parent objected to the curriculum in two of the city's most elite academic institutions. Paul Rossi, a math teacher, was told on Sunday that he had been 'relieved of his teaching duties' by Grace Church School in the East Village of Manhattan following his April 13 essay published on Weiss' site. Andrew Gutmann, whose daughter attended The Brearley School, an all-girls private school in New York City, located on the Upper East Side, wrote a letter, also on April 13, to other parents complaining about efforts to 'brainwash' students with 'woke' philosophies rather than teaching them how to think on their own. Weiss, who was the first to publish Gutmann's letter on April 16, on Monday denounced her former employer for ignoring their stories. 'In a sane world, you would have read Paul Rossi's essay or Andrew Gutmann's letter in the paper of record,' she wrote. 'But such pieces will not appear in the Op-Ed pages of The New York Times or The Washington Post because those papers have mostly ignored the story of the ideological takeover of schools. 'In part, that is because they are implicated in the story: The same ideological force transforming schools like Grace Church and Brearley has also transformed the establishment press.' Weiss resigned in part because of what she saw as a stifling atmosphere, where free thinking was discouraged in favor of adherence to 'woke' mantras. The New York Times has written about Grace Church School's expansion plans, and in the context of parents debating whether school fees were worth it. But it does not appear to have covered Rossi's row with head teacher George P. Davison, which ended with his dismissal. Weiss said in her newsletter that she had received an email from a former parent at Grace Church, who said that one week of every month was devoted to 'CRT'- Critical Race Theory. 'I'm a former parent. My son had Paul Rossi,' the email stated. 'Sadly, Mr. Rossi's account is not hyperbole. One week out of the month is now fully devoted to CRT (not academics). 'Grace was in the news earlier this year as well for it's language guide, which suggested (among other things) that students and teachers say folks or parents or family and not specifically mom and dad because not all kids have mom and dads and such a person might be offended if you ask about their mom and dad. 'The goal of education cannot be to eliminate all possibility of offense.' Weiss added: 'The problem is that The New York Times would never have printed this at all. It'd be like the Catholic Church embracing John Calvin. The inability to tell such stories is one of the reasons I left.' Rossi on Monday responded to Grace Church's decision to bar him from classrooms. In a letter to the head of the school, Davison, Rossi said he was 'compelled to share what you have told me in our previous conversations'. Rossi complained that Grace Church, which charges $57,000 a year, was overly focused on anti-racism training, and that it was hampering students' education. He said that Davison shared his views privately, writing - in an email published by campaign group Fair For All - that Davison had told him he had 'grave doubts about some of the doctrinaire stuff that gets spouted at us, in the name of antiracism.' Rossi also hit back at Davison's complaint at the issue being shared in the press. Rossi said he had shared his concerns privately over several years, but was 'repeatedly shut down'. Rossi said Davison had admitted privately that the school was 'demonizing white people for being born'. Topher Nichols, the school spokesman, told DailyMail.com Monday: 'I can confirm that Paul was relieved of his teaching duties. 'He has been invited to spend the remainder of his contract with the school contributing to a new task force that will review best practices nationwide around belonging.' Nichols elaborated on why Rossi was 'relieved of his teaching duties,' saying it was because 'numerous students requested to be removed from his class because of his unprofessional conduct and because he demeaned them in the press.' Last week, Rossi said he decided to come forward because he could no longer stay silent while 'witnessing the harmful impact' that anti-racism instruction has on children. He said it cultivated in children 'despondency, resentment, and moral superiority'. Gutmann, 45, said that he penned his 1,700-word letter he mailed to 650 different families because 'someone had to speak out.' He said he does not regret sending the letter. 'She hasn't been brainwashed yet by the school — but she's had me at home. I'm not so sure that's true of the other kids,' Gutmann said. 'Someone had to do it. Someone had to light the match. Everyone's so afraid of cancel culture. We're going to destroy the city, we're going to destroy the country.' Gutmann said he he refused to sign the school's anti-racism pledge in October. The school had started the required pledge after black alumnae accused the school of racism in posts made to the Instagram account account 'Black at Brearley,' according to the Washington Free Beacon. The school's antiracism and diversity plans are extensively described on its website. 'I thought they were going to kick my daughter out then,' Gutmann said. 'They didn't but next year they have the pledge built into the yearly school contract.' The concerned dad claimed that the school's 'once-rigorous curriculum' completely changed after administrators 'managed to sneak' in an increased emphasis on race during the pandemic 'when everyone was distracted,' the New York Post reported. April 13, 2021 Dear Fellow Brearley Parents, Our family recently made the decision not to reenroll our daughter at Brearley for the 2021-22 school year. She has been at Brearley for seven years, beginning in kindergarten. In short, we no longer believe that Brearley’s administration and Board of Trustees have any of our children’s best interests at heart. Moreover, we no longer have confidence that our daughter will receive the quality of education necessary to further her development into a critically thinking, responsible, enlightened, and civic minded adult. I write to you, as a fellow parent, to share our reasons for leaving the Brearley community but also to urge you to act before the damage to the school, to its community, and to your own child's education is irreparable. It cannot be stated strongly enough that Brearley’s obsession with race must stop. It should be abundantly clear to any thinking parent that Brearley has completely lost its way. The administration and the Board of Trustees have displayed a cowardly and appalling lack of leadership by appeasing an anti-intellectual, illiberal mob, and then allowing the school to be captured by that same mob. What follows are my own personal views on Brearley's antiracism initiatives, but these are just a handful of the criticisms that I know other parents have expressed. I object to the view that I should be judged by the color of my skin. I cannot tolerate a school that not only judges my daughter by the color of her skin, but encourages and instructs her to prejudge others by theirs. By viewing every element of education, every aspect of history, and every facet of society through the lens of skin color and race, we are desecrating the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and utterly violating the movement for which such civil rights leaders believed, fought, and died. I object to the charge of systemic racism in this country, and at our school. Systemic racism, properly understood, is segregated schools and separate lunch counters. It is the interning of Japanese and the exterminating of Jews. Systemic racism is unequivocally not a small number of isolated incidences over a period of decades. Ask any girl, of any race, if they have ever experienced insults from friends, have ever felt slighted by teachers or have ever suffered the occasional injustice from a school at which they have spent up to 13 years of their life, and you are bound to hear grievances, some petty, some not. We have not had systemic racism against Blacks in this country since the civil rights reforms of the 1960s, a period of more than 50 years. To state otherwise is a flat-out misrepresentation of our country's history and adds no understanding to any of today's societal issues. If anything, longstanding and widespread policies such as affirmative action, point in precisely the opposite direction. I object to a definition of systemic racism, apparently supported by Brearley, that any educational, professional, or societal outcome where Blacks are underrepresented is prima facie evidence of the aforementioned systemic racism, or of white supremacy and oppression. Facile and unsupported beliefs such as these are the polar opposite to the intellectual and scientific truth for which Brearley claims to stand. Furthermore, I call bulls** on Brearley's oft-stated assertion that the school welcomes and encourages the truly difficult and uncomfortable conversations regarding race and the roots of racial discrepancies. I object to the idea that Blacks are unable to succeed in this country without aid from government or from whites. Brearley, by adopting critical race theory, is advocating the abhorrent viewpoint that Blacks should forever be regarded as helpless victims, and are incapable of success regardless of their skills, talents, or hard work. What Brearley is teaching our children is precisely the true and correct definition of racism. I object to mandatory anti-racism training for parents, especially when presented by the rent-seeking charlatans of Pollyanna. These sessions, in both their content and delivery, are so sophomoric and simplistic, so unsophisticated and inane, that I would be embarrassed if they were taught to Brearley kindergarteners. They are an insult to parents and unbecoming of any educational institution, let alone one of Brearley's caliber. I object to Brearley’s vacuous, inappropriate, and fanatical use of words such as “equity,” “diversity” and “inclusiveness.” If Brearley’s administration was truly concerned about so-called “equity,” it would be discussing the cessation of admissions preferences for legacies, siblings, and those families with especially deep pockets. If the administration was genuinely serious about “diversity,” it would not insist on the indoctrination of its students, and their families, to a single mindset, most reminiscent of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Instead, the school would foster an environment of intellectual openness and freedom of thought. And if Brearley really cared about “inclusiveness,” the school would return to the concepts encapsulated in the motto “One Brearley,” instead of teaching the extraordinarily divisive idea that there are only, and always, two groups in this country: victims and oppressors. l object to Brearley’s advocacy for groups and movements such as Black Lives Matter, a Marxist, anti family, heterophobic, anti-Asian and anti-Semitic organization that neither speaks for the majority of the Black community in this country, nor in any way, shape or form, represents their best interests. I object to, as we have been told time and time again over the past year, that the school’s first priority is the safety of our children. For goodness sake, Brearley is a school, not a hospital! The number one priority of a school has always been, and always will be, education. Brearley’s misguided priorities exemplify both the safety culture and “cover-your-ass” culture that together have proved so toxic to our society and have so damaged the mental health and resiliency of two generations of children, and counting. I object to the gutting of the history, civics, and classical literature curriculums. I object to the censorship of books that have been taught for generations because they contain dated language potentially offensive to the thin-skinned and hypersensitive (something that has already happened in my daughter's 4th grade class). I object to the lowering of standards for the admission of students and for the hiring of teachers. I object to the erosion of rigor in classwork and the escalation of grade inflation. Any parent with eyes open can foresee these inevitabilities should antiracism initiatives be allowed to persist. We have today in our country, from both political parties, and at all levels of government, the most unwise and unvirtuous leaders in our nation’s history. Schools like Brearley are supposed to be the training grounds for those leaders. Our nation will not survive a generation of leadership even more poorly educated than we have now, nor will we survive a generation of students taught to hate its own country and despise its history. Lastly, I object, with as strong a sentiment as possible, that Brearley has begun to teach what to think, instead of how to think. I object that the school is now fostering an environment where our daughters, and our daughters’ teachers, are afraid to speak their minds in class for fear of “consequences.” I object that Brearley is trying to usurp the role of parents in teaching morality, and bullying parents to adopt that false morality at home. I object that Brearley is fostering a divisive community where families of different races, which until recently were part of the same community, are now segregated into two. These are the reasons why we can no longer send our daughter to Brearley. Over the past several months, I have personally spoken to many Brearley parents as well as parents of children at peer institutions. It is abundantly clear that the majority of parents believe that Brearley’s antiracism policies are misguided, divisive, counterproductive and cancerous. Many believe, as I do, that these policies will ultimately destroy what was until recently, a wonderful educational institution. But as I am sure will come as no surprise to you, given the insidious cancel culture that has of late permeated our society, most parents are too fearful to speak up. But speak up you must. There is strength in numbers and I assure you, the numbers are there. Contact the administration and the Board of Trustees and demand an end to the destructive and anti-intellectual claptrap known as antiracism. And if changes are not forthcoming then demand new leadership. For the sake of our community, our city, our country and most of all, our children, silence is no longer an option. Respectfully, Andrew Gutmann ",News,4/20/2021
Walter Mondale dies aged 93: Jimmy Carter calls him 'the best vice president in our country's history' as tributes pour in to the man who lost in landslide to Ronald Reagan in 1984 when he bluntly told voters he would increase their taxes,"Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, a liberal icon who lost the most lopsided presidential election after bluntly telling voters to expect a tax increase if he won, died Monday. He was 93. The death of the former senator, ambassador and Minnesota attorney general was announced in a statement from his family. No cause was cited. Mondale followed the trail blazed by his political mentor, Hubert H. Humphrey, from Minnesota politics to the U.S. Senate and the vice presidency, serving under Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981. In a final email to 320 staff who had worked for him over four decades, Mondale told his staffers how much they meant to him, adding he knew that they'd keep up 'the good fight' and 'Joe in the White House certainly helps.' In a statement Monday night, Carter said he considered Mondale 'the best vice president in our country's history.' He added: 'Fritz Mondale provided us all with a model for public service and private behavior.' 'During our administration, Fritz used his political skill and personal integrity to transform the vice presidency into a dynamic, policy-driving force that had never been seen before and still exists today. He was an invaluable partner and an able servant of the people of Minnesota, the United States and the World,' Carter added. His own try for the White House, in 1984, came at the zenith of Ronald Reagan´s popularity. Mondale´s selection of Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New York as his running mate made him the first major-party presidential nominee to put a woman on the ticket, but his declaration that he would raise taxes helped define the race. On Election Day, he carried only his home state and the District of Columbia. The electoral vote was 525-13 for Reagan - the biggest landslide in the Electoral College since Franklin Roosevelt defeated Alf Landon in 1936. (Sen. George McGovern got 17 electoral votes in his 1972 defeat, winning Massachusetts and Washington, D.C.) 'I did my best,' Mondale said the day after the election, and blamed no one but himself. 'I think you know I´ve never really warmed up to television,' he said. 'In fairness to television, it never really warmed up to me.' Years later, Mondale said his campaign message had proven to be the right one. 'History has vindicated me that we would have to raise taxes,' he said. 'It was very unpopular, but it was undeniably correct.' In 2002, state and national Democrats looked to Mondale when Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., was killed in a plane crash less than two weeks before Election Day. Mondale agreed to stand in for Wellstone, and early polls showed him with a lead over the Republican candidate, Norm Coleman. But the 53-year-old Coleman, emphasizing his youth and vigor, out-hustled the then-74-year-old Mondale in an intense six-day campaign. Mondale was also hurt by a partisan memorial service for Wellstone, in which thousands of Democrats booed Republican politicians in attendance. One speaker pleaded: 'We are begging you to help us win this election for Paul Wellstone.' Polls showed the service put off independents and cost Mondale votes. Coleman won by 3 percentage points. 'The eulogizers were the ones hurt the most,' Mondale said after the election. 'It doesn´t justify it, but we all make mistakes. Can´t we now find it in our hearts to forgive them and go on?' It was a particularly bitter defeat for Mondale, who even after his loss to Reagan had taken solace in his perfect record in Minnesota. 'One of the things I´m most proud of,' he said in 1987, 'is that not once in my public career did I ever lose an election in Minnesota.' Years after the 2002 defeat, Mondale returned to the Senate to stand beside Democrat Al Franken in 2009 when he was sworn in to replace Coleman after a drawn-out recount and court battle. Mondale started his career in Washington in 1964, when he was appointed to the Senate to replace Humphrey, who had resigned to become vice president. Mondale was elected to a full six-year term with about 54% of the vote in 1966, although Democrats lost the governorship and suffered other election setbacks. In 1972, Mondale won another Senate term with nearly 57% of the vote. His Senate career was marked by advocacy of social issues such as education, housing, migrant workers and child nutrition. Like Humphrey, he was an outspoken supporter of civil rights. Mondale tested the waters for a presidential bid in 1974 but ultimately decided against it. 'Basically I found I did not have the overwhelming desire to be president, which is essential for the kind of campaign that is required,' he said in November 1974. In 1976, Carter chose Mondale as No. 2 on his ticket and went on to unseat Gerald Ford. As vice president, Mondale had a close relationship with Carter. He was the first vice president to occupy an office in the White House, rather than in a building across the street. Mondale traveled extensively on Carter´s behalf, and advised him on domestic and foreign affairs. While he lacked Humphrey´s charisma, Mondale had a droll sense of humor. When he dropped out of the 1976 presidential sweepstakes, he said, 'I don´t want to spend the next two years in Holiday Inns.' Reminded of that shortly before he was picked as Carter´s running mate, Mondale said, 'I´ve checked and found that they´re all redecorated, and they´re marvelous places to stay.' Mondale never backed away from his liberal principles. 'I think that the country more than ever needs progressive values,' Mondale said in 1989. That year, Democrats tried to persuade him to challenge Minnesota GOP Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, but he decided against making the race, saying it was time to make way for a new generation. 'One of the requirements of a healthy party is that it renews itself,' he said at the time. 'You can´t keep running Walter Mondale for everything.' That paved the way for Wellstone to win the Democratic nomination, and go on to upset Boschwitz. Wellstone had been preparing to take on Mondale in a primary but would have been a heavy underdog. The son of a Methodist minister and a music teacher, Walter Frederick Mondale was born Jan. 5, 1928, in tiny Ceylon, Minnesota, and grew up in several small southern Minnesota towns. He was only 20 when he served as a congressional district manager for Humphrey´s successful Senate campaign in 1948. His education, interrupted by a two-year stint in the Army, culminated with a law degree from the University of Minnesota in 1956. Mondale began a law practice in Minneapolis and ran the successful 1958 gubernatorial campaign of Democrat Orville Freeman, who appointed Mondale state attorney general in 1960. Mondale was elected attorney general in the fall of 1960 and was reelected in 1962. As attorney general, Mondale moved quickly into civil rights, antitrust and consumer protection cases. He was the first Minnesota attorney general to make consumer protection a campaign issue. After his White House years, Mondale served from 1993-96 as President Bill Clinton´s ambassador to Japan, fighting for U.S. access to markets ranging from cars to cellular phones. He helped avert a trade war in June 1995 over autos and auto parts, persuading Japanese officials to give American automakers more access to Japanese dealers and pushing Japanese carmakers to buy U.S. parts. Mondale kept his ties to the Clintons. In 2008, he endorsed Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton for president, switching his allegiance only after Barack Obama sealed the nomination. When Democrats came to him after Wellstone´s death, Mondale was working at the Minneapolis law firm of Dorsey & Whitney and serving on corporate and nonprofit boards. He returned to the firm after the brief campaign. Mondale and his wife, Joan Adams Mondale, were married in 1955. During his vice presidency, she pushed for more government support of the arts and gained the nickname 'Joan of Art.' She had minored in art in college and worked at museums in Boston and Minneapolis. The couple had two sons, Ted and William, and a daughter, Eleanor. Eleanor Mondale became a broadcast journalist and TV host, with credits including 'CBS This Morning' and programs with E! Entertainment Television. Ted Mondale served six years in the Minnesota Senate and made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1998. William Mondale served for a time as an assistant attorney general. Joan Mondale died in 2014 at age 83 after an extended illness.",News,4/20/2021
Kiss goodbye to foreign travel: State Department plans 'Do Not travel' advisories for 80% of countries due to COVID,"The U.S. Department of State announced on Monday it will issue a 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' advisory, its highest warning, for about 80 percent of countries. In an official statement, the agency said the risk of COVID-19 while traveling remains too high and urged Americans to 'reconsider all travel abroad.' 'This does not imply a reassessment of the current health situation in a given country, but rather reflects an adjustment in the State Department's Travel Advisory system to rely more on CDC's existing epidemiological assessments,' the statement read. Level 4 is generally reserved for war-torn countries or nations that would be hostile to Americans such as Afghanistan and North Korea. Most countries are currently listed on the State Department website with a 'Level 3 - Reconsider Travel' warning, the second-highest alert. Currently, there are 33 countries listed as Level 4. They include: Afghanistan, Argentina, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Central African Republic, Chad, Cuba, Curacao, French Guiana, French West Indies, Georgia, Haiti, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kenya, Kosovo, Libya, Mali, Montenegro, Mozambique, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Turkmenistan, Turks and Caicos, Venezuela, Yemen. It is unknown which countries will be added to the list, but it is believed the list will include several nations in Asia, Central America and Europe. According to the statement, the advisories will begin being updated this week to be in line withTravel Health Notices issued by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) The advisories also 'take into account logistical factors, including in-country testing availability and current travel restrictions for U.S. citizens.' Only three countries - Macau, New Zealand and Taiwan - are currently listed as 'Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions.' On April 2, the CDC issued new guidelines stating that people who are fully vaccinated can travel safely within the U.S and internationally. Travelers are considered fully vaccinated if it has been more than two weeks after their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines or after the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine. However, the agency still advised against non-essential travel due to spread of the virus and not enough people vaccinated yet to reach herd immunity. 'Every time there's a surge in travel, we have a surge of cases in this country,' CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky said last month. 'We're hopeful that our next set of guidance, will have more science around what vaccinated people can do, perhaps travel being among them.' The CDC still requires a negative test result within the last 72 hours for people of all nationalities flying to the U.S., including Americans returning from abroad. Those who are fully vaccinated, both U.S. citizens and foreigners, do not need to self-quarantine after arriving. Although the CDC can make nationwide recommendations for what it deems safe, the agency cannot enforce rules. Each U.S. state sets its own requirements when it comes to testing, quarantining or other precautions visitors need to take. The majority of states have dropped travel restrictions for travelers but there are exceptions, including Hawaii. It comes as more than a million people continue to pass through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints every day, which has been occurring since March 10. On Sunday, 1.57 million Americans were screened by airport security, which was the highest number in more than two weeks - and higher than figures seen over the Christmas and New Year's holiday.",News,4/20/2021
Johnson & Johnson claims research found that Moderna and Pfizer cause blood clots too - but the author of the study says that is FALSE ,"Johnson & Johnson defended its COVID-19 vaccine amid worries it may cause blood clots by saying that clots have been reported with all three shots authorized in the U.S., citing a study published in February. But that study did not find blood clots related to the other two vaccines, made by Pfizer and Moderna. And J&J is now under fire from the author of the very study it cited, for misrepresenting the findings of her research. 'We didn't find anyone with blood clots,' Dr Eun-Ju Lee, an assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and lead author of the study in question told CNN. 'We didn't find any of those scary things that are happening with Johnson & Johnson.' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials are investigating seven reports of blood clots, which can cause fatal brain bleeds, in people who had gotten J&J's shot two weeks prior. The agencies have placed a hold on the use of the vaccine until their investigation concludes. New guidelines regarding the shot are expected to be issued Friday. In addition to concerns that Johnson & Johnson's statement was misleading, experts are worried its false claims will fuel further distrust in vaccines - and 20 percent of Americans are already hesitant to get the shots. So how did Johnson & Johnson get its media statement, shared by CNN, so wrong? The Weill Cornell study did find people who developed a low platelet count condition after getting Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. This particular condition, known as thrombocytopenia, can sometimes lead to blood clots. When platelet counts drop, the body may start to ramp up production of another blood compound, known as thrombin, to try to make up for the lost platelets. In rare cases, this can lead to clots - and in even rarer cases, scientists think vaccines may trigger a type of antibody that leads to the decline in platelet counts (and then to thrombosis, or blood clots). The Cornell study, published in February 2019, identified 20 cases of thrombocytopenia, suggesting the clots might be forming reported to the U.S. side effect tracking system within 14 days after vaccination with Pfizer or Moderna's shots. But finding these cases after vaccination isn't enough to prove a link. Nine of them had received the Pfizer vaccine and 11 had gotten Moderna's. Three of the people identified in the study had histories of blood clots or low platelet counts, one had a family history of blood clots and already had an abnormal platelet count - a warning sign for the particular clotting condition scientists worry may be triggered by J&J's vaccine - before their shot. Fifteen had been treated for suspected cases of low platelet counts and three had autoimmune conditions that raised their risks for dangerous clots or low platelet counts. There were five cases of thrombocytopenia reported that could not be decisively ruled out as related or unrelated to the vaccines. Ultimately, the study found less than one case of low platelet counts per million vaccinations, amongst the 20 million people who had been vaccinated by the end of the study. The rate of the low platelet count condition 'appears either less than or roughly comparable to what would be seenif the cases were coincidental following vaccination, perhaps enhanced somewhat by heightened surveillance of symptomatic patients,' the study authors wrote. That is markedly different from what is seen in the seven people who developed blood clots after getting Johnson & Johnson's vaccine. One person who developed thrombocytopenia was as man in the clinical trial who died. SInce then, another six women, all between 18 and 48, have developed low platelet counts after getting the one-dose J&J shot, and one woman died. It's still a rate of about one in a million, but the women's symptoms were particularly severe, and similar to the issues seen with AstraZeneca's vaccine in Europe, which ultimately led some countries to stop recommending it for people under 30. Dr Anthony Fauci said Sunday that he doubts that the use of J&J's shot will be cancelled altogether in the U.S. More likely, updated CDC and FDA recommendations, expected on Friday, will advise it only be used for some age groups and genders, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy told CNN on Monday.",News,4/20/2021
'Maxine Waters believes there is value in violence': Kevin McCarthy says up to 15 Dems could vote for his motion to censure Waters and warns it is not the first time she has called for violent unrest,"House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has claimed that up to 15 Democrats could vote for his motion to censure California Representative Maxine Waters after she told Black Lives Matters protesters to 'get more confrontational' in Minneapolis on Saturday night. During an interview with on Fox News Primetime, McCarthy said the congresswoman 'believes there is value in violence'. 'And now what she has said has even put doubt into a jury,' McCarthy said, referring to the George Floyd jury that started deliberations on Monday in the murder trial of former Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin. 'You had a judge announce that it was wrong. I think this takes action especially when she has a pattern of this behavior,' McCarthy continued. He was referring to Waters' 2018 remarks when she told Californians to 'get in the face' of Trump administration staffers if they see them in public. McCarthy said he believes there are 'probably 10 to 15' Democrats who would vote for censure. Scroll down for video 'It will all come down to the pressure of what Democrats will put on them to just try to vote to table it - not even to have the discussion,' he added. McCarthy's remarks Monday night came just hours after he claimed in a tweet that Waters 'broke the law by violating curfew and then incited violence' while in Minneapolis over the weekend. He then accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of 'ignoring Waters’ behavior,' which he said prompted him to introduce 'a resolution to censure Rep. Waters for these dangerous comments'. McCarthy's move came as the judge in Chauvin's trial said the congresswoman's comments could have given the defense grounds for an appeal. Speaking after the jury was sent out on Monday afternoon, Chauvin's attorney Eric Nelson once again made a bid to have the case against his client thrown out on grounds that there was no way the jury could be untainted by the excessive publicity surrounding the case. 'Now that we have US representatives threatening acts of violence in relation to this trial it’s frankly mind-blowing,' Nelson said. Taking it into consideration Judge Peter Cahill said: 'I grant you Congresswoman Waters may have handed you grounds for appeal and the turning over of this trial.' Judge Cahill denied Nelson’s move for a mistrial but he said: 'I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case. They should respect a co-equal branch of government.' He said that failure to do so was 'abhorrent', but added: 'I don't think it's given additional material with which to prejudice the jury.A congresswoman’s opinion really doesn't mean much.' McCarthy's move could get Waters removed from her committee assignments but, given Democratic control of the House, it will go nowhere if Democrats stick together. White House press secretary Jen Psaki refused to condemn her remarks and Pelosi insisted Waters shouldn't apologize. But Republicans pounced on Waters' remarks to theBlack Lives Matter protesters. Senator Ted Cruz and controversial Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene also criticized Waters, who, over the weekend, joined demonstrations over the police shooting of Daunte Wright,a black 20-year-old shot and killed at a traffic stop by a white police officer, Kimberly Potter. But many of these Republicans accusing Waters of inciting violence did not make the same charge against then-President Donald Trump in the wake of the January 6 MAGA riot on Capitol Hill, that left five dead and a trail of destruction throughout the Capitol. Cruz and Greene were some of Trump's most ardent defenders. McCarthy did take to the House floor to declare Trump, who riled up the crowd with his false claims the election was stolen, 'bears responsibility' for the attack on Congress. McCarthy later flew to Mar-a-Lago to make peace with the former president after Trump became furious at him for his words. Republicans have turned Waters into a punching bag before - notably for her urging the public to harass Trump White House staffers when they saw them in public. Waters traveled to Minneapolis the weekend before closing arguments in the trial of Derek Chauvin, charged with murdering George Floyd on May 25. The city is bracing for the verdict in the Chauvin case.More than 3,000 members of the National Guard are in Minneapolis, in addition to 1,100 officers from public safety agencies across the state as part of what has been termed Operation Safety Net.

'I am not happy that we have talked about police reform for so long,' Waters said, demanding a guilty verdict in the Chauvin trial and adding:'If we don't [get it], we cannot go away. We've got to stay on the street.' She added that protesters needed 'get more active, more confrontational' and they should ignore the curfew in place. 'We’ve got to stay on the street and we’ve got to get more active, we’ve got to get more confrontational. We’ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business,' she said when it comes to police shootings. Hours after Waters' passionate speech, a Minnesota National Guard and Minneapolis police team were fired upon in a drive-by shooting. The team was providing neighborhood security in Minneapolis when, at about 4.19am local time, a light colored SUV drove by and blasted shots at an occupied National Guard vehicle.

'As long as the Left appeases their anti-America base, their job is done.' And Marjorie Taylor Greene, congresswoman for Georgia, called for her to be expelled from Congress. 'As a sitting United States Congresswoman @MaxineWaters threatened a jury demanding a guilty verdict and threatened violence if Chauvin is found not guilty.

Rep. Maxine Waters 'requested police protection' during Minnesota trip where she told protesters to get more 'confrontational',"California Representative Maxine Waters reportedly requested police protection while on a Minnesota trip where she told protesters to get more 'confrontational'. According to a travel log obtained by Townhalleditor Katie Pavlich, Waters requested a US Capitol Police escort on Saturday. While images don't show police with Waters at the protest, the log appears to show a special request for officers to escort her 'in & out' of Minneapolis.No other information about the police escort was immediately available. Waters flew from Dulles International Airport to Minnesota-St Paul International Airport to stand with protesters demanding justice for George Floyd amid the murder case of Derek Chauvin. In front of a large crowd on Saturday, Waters said she hoped Chauvin was found guilty. 'I am not happy that we have talked about police reform for so long,' Waters said, demanding a guilty verdict in the Chauvin trial and adding:'If we don't [get it], we cannot go away. We've got to stay on the street.' She added that protesters needed to 'get more active, more confrontational' and they should ignore the curfew in place. 'We’ve got to stay on the street and we’ve got to get more active, we’ve got to get more confrontational. We’ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business,' she said when it comes to police shootings. Meanwhile, several Republicans have slammed Waters for her remarks. On Monday, House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy claimed that up to 15 Democrats could vote for his motion to censure Waters. During an interview with on Fox News Primetime, McCarthy said the congresswoman 'believes there is value in violence'. 'And now what she has said has even put doubt into a jury,' McCarthy said, referring to the George Floyd jury that started deliberations on Monday in the murder trial of former Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin. 'You had a judge announce that it was wrong. I think this takes action especially when she has a pattern of this behavior,' McCarthy continued. He was referring to Waters' 2018 remarks when she told Californians to 'get in the face' of Trump administration staffers if they see them in public. McCarthy said he believes there are 'probably 10 to 15' Democrats who would vote for censure. 'It will all come down to the pressure of what Democrats will put on them to just try to vote to table it - not even to have the discussion,' he added. McCarthy's remarks Monday night came just hours after he claimed in a tweet that Waters 'broke the law by violating curfew and then incited violence' while in Minneapolis over the weekend. He then accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of 'ignoring Waters’ behavior,' which he said prompted him to introduce 'a resolution to censure Rep. Waters for these dangerous comments'. McCarthy's move came as the judge in Chauvin's trial said the congresswoman's comments could have given the defense grounds for an appeal. Speaking after the jury was sent out on Monday afternoon, Chauvin's attorney Eric Nelson once again made a bid to have the case against his client thrown out on grounds that there was no way the jury could be untainted by the excessive publicity surrounding the case. 'Now that we have US representatives threatening acts of violence in relation to this trial it’s frankly mind-blowing,' Nelson said. Taking it into consideration Judge Peter Cahill said: 'I grant you Congresswoman Waters may have handed you grounds for appeal and the turning over of this trial.' Judge Cahill denied Nelson’s move for a mistrial but he said: 'I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case. They should respect a co-equal branch of government.' He said that failure to do so was 'abhorrent', but added: 'I don't think it's given additional material with which to prejudice the jury.A congresswoman’s opinion really doesn't mean much.' McCarthy's move could get Waters removed from her committee assignments but, given Democratic control of the House, it will go nowhere if Democrats stick together. White House press secretary Jen Psaki refused to condemn her remarks and Pelosi insisted Waters shouldn't apologize. But Republicans pounced on Waters' remarks to theBlack Lives Matter protesters. Senator Ted Cruz and controversial Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene also criticized Waters, who, over the weekend, joined demonstrations over the police shooting of Daunte Wright,a black 20-year-old shot and killed at a traffic stop by a white police officer, Kimberly Potter. But many of these Republicans accusing Waters of inciting violence did not make the same charge against then-President Donald Trump in the wake of the January 6 MAGA riot on Capitol Hill, that left five dead and a trail of destruction throughout the Capitol. Cruz and Greene were some of Trump's most ardent defenders. McCarthy did take to the House floor to declare Trump, who riled up the crowd with his false claims the election was stolen, 'bears responsibility' for the attack on Congress. McCarthy later flew to Mar-a-Lago to make peace with the former president after Trump became furious at him for his words. Republicans have turned Waters into a punching bag before - notably for her urging the public to harass Trump White House staffers when they saw them in public.
