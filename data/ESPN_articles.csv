"Jury finds Derek Chauvin guilty of two murder counts, one manslaughter count in George Floyd verdict","Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter by a jury for his role in the murder of George Floyd last May. (5:35) Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter by a jury Tuesday for his role in the murder of George Floyd last May outside of a local convenience store. Floyd's death, and the video that showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for about nine minutes, became a catalyst for the sports world's racial and social justice movement last summer. A jury of six white, four Black and two multiracial jurors deliberated nine hours over two days -- five hours on Monday; four hours Tuesday -- before rendering a verdict. ABCNews.com has full coverage of the decision. Chauvin faces a 40-year maximum sentence for the second-degree unintentional murder conviction, a 25-year sentence for third-degree murder and a 10-year sentence for second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin's bail was immediately revoked, and his sentencing will be in eight weeks. ""One year ago, George Floyd was murdered, causing unimaginable pain and trauma for his family, the Minneapolis community, and communities across the nation,"" the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves and WNBA's Minnesota Lynx said in a joint statement Tuesday. ""Our deepest thoughts have been with the Floyd family since this unjust tragedy. Throughout our history, racial and social inequalities have been ingrained in our society. ""We are hopeful that today's decision will serve as a step forward, but it does not ease the physical and emotional pain that continues in an environment where systemic racism exists."" pic.twitter.com/j4SfGALVgj Floyd's death led to nationwide protests and prompted athletes throughout the sports world to speak out about social and racial injustice. Former NBA player Stephen Jackson traveled to Minnesota the week Floyd died and said, ""I'm hurt, I'm angry, but I ain't scared"" in an emotional speech alongside fellow NBA players Karl-Anthony Towns and Josh Okogie. Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics drove 15 hours to march at a protest in Atlanta. NBA and WNBA players spoke out frequently, and both leagues resumed their seasons with ""Black Lives Matter"" painted on the court. ""Through peaceful protest, we must demand strong leadership at all levels that is equally committed to achieving true social justice,"" the Women's National Basketball Players Association said in a statement the week of Floyd's death. As news of Floyd's death spread, LeBron James posted a Twitter message with a photo of Floyd alongside an image of Colin Kaepernick and wrote, ""Do you understand NOW!!??!!??"" Magic Johnson tweeted, ""How many times do we have to see Black men killed on national television?"" Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr tweeted, ""This is murder. Disgusting. Seriously, what the hell is wrong with US????"" On Tuesday, James tweeted just one word: ""ACCOUNTABILITY."" The NBA and National Basketball Players Association issued a joint statement Tuesday, saying, ""we are pleased that justice appears to have been served"" but also adding that ""there is much work to be done."" The WNBA said the verdict was ""a step toward justice."" Atlanta Hawks interim coach Nate McMillan on Tuesday said there was uncertainty over whether the team's game against the Orlando Magic would've been played had the ruling been different. ""We, as a league, we really didn't know if we were going to play this game,"" McMillan said. ""... I feel that the jury did their jobs. You got to hold everybody accountable for their actions. The jury found him guilty on all three charges. I thought they did their jobs."" Last spring, a group of NFL players, including Patrick Mahomes, appeared in a Twitter video that started with ""It's been 10 days since George Floyd was brutally murdered. How many times do we need to ask you to listen to your players? What will it take? For one of us to be murdered by police brutality?"" and asking, ""What if I was George Floyd?"" When the NFL season opened in September, the Minnesota Vikings honored Floyd's family at their opener with a moment of silence and silencing the team's signature Gjallarhorn in his honor. ""Mr. George Floyd should be here with us today,"" the NFL said in a statement Tuesday. The NFL had every team play ""Lift Every Voice And Sing,"" often called the Black national anthem, before season openers, and players wore the names of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black men and women killed by police on the back of their helmets. ""The past year following George Floyd's death has been extremely painful for the Minnesota community, particularly for the State's Black residents,"" the Vikings said in a statement Tuesday. ""While today's decision does not minimize the anguish or solve the intolerable issues of racism and hate, we hope it can mark the beginning of community healing. ""Now, more than ever, it is crucial to respectfully listen, communicate and engage in order for us to move forward toward an equitable society. ... Our work is just beginning. Our commitment is unwavering."" pic.twitter.com/Nyor6lT6X4 pic.twitter.com/Fgq5PBx1cO Minnesota: United. pic.twitter.com/6lsedMdHcB Tennis player Naomi Osaka wore the names of Black people killed by police on her masks in her seven matches at the US Open. When a reporter asked her what message she wanted to send, she said: ""Well, what was the message that you got was more the question. I feel like the point is to make people start talking."" On Tuesday, Osaka said she had varying emotions regarding the ruling. ""I was going to make a celebratory tweet but then I was hit with sadness because we are celebrating something that is clear as day,"" Osaka posted on Twitter. ""The fact that so many injustices occurred to make us hold our breath toward this outcome is really telling."" The USC football team said it postponed Tuesday's practice to instead take the time to ""discuss the racial injustices prevalent in our society and in our daily lives."" The Major League Baseball Players Association said it remains committed ""to the difficult work of healing and advancing the cause of civil rights and equal justice under the law,"" while MLB said it would continue to work with its players concerning ""social justice, equality, diversity and inclusion."" Floyd was killed on May 25 after Minneapolis police officers responded to a call shortly after 8 p.m. about a possible forgery at a corner grocery store. Floyd, saying he was claustrophobic as officers tried to put him in a squad car, ended up handcuffed and face-down in the street. Chauvin used his knee to pin Floyd's neck as bystanders shouted at him to stop. Bystander video shows Floyd crying, ""I can't breathe"" multiple times before going limp. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. He was 46. Police initially issued a statement saying Floyd died of a ""medical incident."" Bystander video was posted online the next day, and in the face of growing protests in Minneapolis and nationwide, police said the FBI would investigate. Chauvin and three other officers were eventually fired as Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for criminal charges against Chauvin. Chauvin, age 45 and a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis police force, was arrested on May 29 and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The charges were later upgraded to second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. As protests in Minneapolis and around the country grew, the county medical examiner ruled on June 1 that Floyd's heart stopped as police restrained him and compressed his neck, noting that Floyd had an underlying health issue and listing fentanyl and methamphetamine use as ""other significant conditions."" At trial, prosecutors argued that Chauvin was responsible for Floyd's death by keeping a knee on his neck. The defense argued that he died because of drugs in his system and preexisting health conditions. Three other officers were also arrested and will stand trial together this summer.",Sports News,4/20/2021
Cincinnati Reds' Mike Moustakas to IL with non-COVID-19 illness,The Cincinnati Reds placed starting third baseman Mike Moustakas on the 10-day injured list with a non-COVID-19 illness.

Moustakas has two homers and five RBIs in 12 games this season and is slashing .289/.404/.553. The Reds reinstated infielder Alex Blandino from the injured list in a corresponding move.,Sports News,4/20/2021
Derek Chauvin verdict reaction: The sports world responds on social media,"Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter by a jury for his role in the murder of George Floyd last May. (5:35) On Tuesday, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty to the charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. Floyd, 46, died on May 25, 2020, while in Minneapolis police custody. Bystander videos showed that Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, and the county medical examiner ruled the death a homicide. After the release of the video, the Minneapolis Police Department fired Chauvin and the three other officers involved, and Chauvin was charged with the three crimes. He pleaded not guilty to all three. Last summer, athletes boycotted games in multiple leagues to protest the deaths of Black men and women caused by law enforcement. Here's what the sports world had to say about Tuesday's verdict: ACCOUNTABILITY Love Wins. Accountability is now trending 📈 Justice and Accountability! Things I never thought I would see. There's much more work to do, but this is an amazing start working toward the reform this country NEEDS! Sending love and strength to Minn today, to the family and community of #GeorgeFloyd and so many others. Whatever happens, #derickchauvin killed George, we know this.

It's a beautiful thing when the judicial system works as it's intended! 👏🏾 Today, justice was served for George Floyd.His loved ones can hopefully sleep easier.The time to collectively examine the treatment of Black people, in particular Black boys/men, by some law enforcement is long overdue. The path to healing must begin. #BlackLivesMatter I don't celebrate the demise of another persons life no matter what they've done but I do celebrate JUSTICE, TRUTH AND RIGHTEOUSNESS because for so long that has been void of the criminal justice system in America for black and brown people. #Justice #Truth #Righteousness This should be the norm! No person or profession should be above the law. It won't bring George Floyd back but I'm glad justice was finally served. I hate that we have to celebrate something like this but justice isn't something we are used to in this country YESLORD🙏🏾 This is justice. Love. Peace.

May your soul Rest In Peace. #GeorgeFloyd I hate to be negative on a day a family can at least get a semblance of retribution for the murder of their loved one.

"UTEP athletics punished over football, softball violations","EL PASO, Texas -- UTEP football coach Dana Dimel and former softball coach Tobin Echo-Hawk received one-year show-cause restrictions and the athletic department was placed on a year's probation Tuesday over NCAA violations in both programs. The NCAA said the football team exceeded limits on the size of the coaching staff for two years by allowing offensive and defensive quality control coaches to provide instruction. Echo-Hawk allowed graduate assistants to provide instruction during extra workout sessions as part of violations of limits on the size of the coaching staff and daily and weekly limits on the number of hours athletes are allowed to practice, according to the NCAA. The former coach also didn't give her players a mandatory day off every week. The agreement between UTEP and the NCAA said Echo-Hawk was directly involved in some violations while failing to monitor her staff's involvement. Dimel was held responsible for not monitoring the activity of his staff. Dimel will serve a four-day suspension from coaching activities and a 10-day ban on off-campus recruiting during the 2020-21 football contact period. Echo-Hawk received a four-week suspension from coaching activities and must sit out 15% of regular-season games. She is an assistant at New Mexico State. The school said she was promoted to a paid job last summer after joining Kathy Rodolph's staff as a volunteer.",Sports News,4/20/2021

"Alex Bowman grabs lead with 10 laps left, holds on to win Richmond Cup race","RICHMOND, Va. -- Another week, another agonizing loss for Denny Hamlin. And this time it was to Alex Bowman, who came from nowhere with 10 laps to go at Richmond Raceway to put the No. 48 Chevrolet in victory lane for the first time in nearly four years. Bowman won for the third time in his career Sunday and denied Hamlin a win in a race he had dominated to become the eighth winner in nine Cup races this season. He dedicated the victory to crew member William ``Rowdy'' Harrell and his wife, Blakley Harrell, who were killed in a November car crash in Florida while on their honeymoon. ""This one is for Rowdy and his family. Miss him and Blakley every day,"" Bowman said. Bowman's victory in the No. 48 Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports came on the same day the former driver of the car, seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson, made his debut in the IndyCar Series in Alabama. It was the first victory for the No. 48 since June 4, 2017. Johnson was the only driver of the No. 48 when it was formed in 2001 and Bowman was hand-picked by sponsor Ally to replace him. Bowman overcame a penalty on lap 247 for a loose tire on pit road to rally for the win. For Hamlin, it was the third defeat in three races. At the dirt race at Bristol Motor Speedway he didn't do enough to move Joey Logano out of his way to earn the win, and last week at Martinsville Speedway he was caught late by Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Martin Truex Jr. In Richmond, Hamlin raced with the hashtag (hash)fedexstrong on the back of his car and on his pit wall to honor the eight people who were fatally shot at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis on Thursday. He again had the dominant car and led 207 of the 400 laps. He's led 483 laps the last two weeks. ""First and foremost, we want to think of all of the families in Indy right now,"" Hamlin said. ""Awful tragedy to happen there. Our thoughts and prayers are with these names. We will get (wins). We will keep digging. We are dominating -- just have to finish it."" Hamlin won the first two stages and notched his eighth top-five finish in nine starts this season. ""We just didn't take off quite as good there at the end. I tried to warm it up and do everything that I could -- just the 48 had a little more on those last few laps and I couldn't hold the bottom,"" Hamlin said. Last week, he led 276 laps at Martinsville Speedway, but lost the lead to Truex with 15 laps to go. Hamlin did hang on Sunday to finish second, followed by Logano, Christopher Bell and Truex, who led 107 laps and overcame a penalty for speeding on pit road. Kyle Busch finished eighth, the second week in a row that all four JGR drivers finished in the top 10. ""Denny and I had a hell of a race,"" Logano said. ""It was pretty fun there for a minute, but here we are third. It stings. We were up there all day. ""The 48 kind of snookered everybody."" After three straight races on short tracks, the series heads to the largest track in NASCAR -- 2.66-mile Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama.",Sports News,4/20/2021
