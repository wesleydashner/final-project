Depressed Police Officer Reminds Self That Chauvin Verdict Not Representative Of System At Large,"MINNEAPOLIS—Shaken by the guilty verdict delivered in the trial of Derek Chauvin, local police officer Edward Margolin took comfort Tuesday by remembering that this outcome wasn’t representative of the system at large. “Moments like this can be tough, but it helps to take a step back and remember that this is the exception that proves the rule,” said Margolin, confirming that despite the conviction he still believed in the justice system’s fundamental purpose of exonerating police officers. “In these trying times, I remember everything I have to be grateful for—qualified immunity, powerful police associations, massive budgets, and all the officers I know who have done similar stuff to Chauvin and gotten away scot-free, and it starts to make me calm down. It’s important not to let a little hiccup like this make you lose sight of the big picture.” At press time, a cheerful Margolin had fully regained his faith in the system after taking out a baton and breaking a demonstrator’s arm.",Political News,4/20/2021
"Police Ask Tesla To Drive In Straight Line, Recite Alphabet Backwards After Vehicle Crashes Into Tree","AUSTIN, TX—Flashing their sirens and directing the swerving, damaged Model 3 to pull over on the side of the road, police asked a white, 2019 Tesla to drive in a straight line and recite the alphabet backwards Tuesday after the vehicle crashed into a tree. “Well, well, well, it’s the middle of the day, and we’ve got a self-driving automated vehicle traveling well above the speed limit, swerving between lanes, and running red lights,” said the officer, who then got out of his squad car, walked up to the mid-size sedan, and asked it various questions about where it had been, where its driver was, and why it was going 80 mph in a 30 mph zone, only to receive no response. “Uh huh. Now, I’m going to hold up this pen and move it side to side, and I’m going to need you to follow it with your headlights. After that, I’m going to ask you to put yourself in drive, inch towards me, then stop, then move your left side mirror, and open your sunroof. And if you can’t do that? Looks like you’re coming downtown with me.” At press time, the officer was spotted shaking his head and releasing the Tesla from a tow truck after the car reportedly called the governor and threatened to raise hell.",Political News,4/20/2021
Jimmy Carter Shaken To See Friend Walter Mondale Die So Young,"PLAINS, GA— Struggling to process the sudden and unexpected loss, former President Jimmy Carter was reportedly feeling shaken Tuesday to see his friend Walter Mondale die so young. “I can’t believe Walter’s gone—and cut down in his prime, at that,” said the 39th president of the United States, who pledged to no longer take life for granted and live each day to its fullest after learning the former vice president, 93, had died at home on Monday. “I know I still have decades ahead of me, but wow, this just goes to show that anything can happen. This is crazy. Just the other day we were playing tennis, and now poof, he’s gone.

Homicide Detectives Announce They Looking For Real Knockout After Discovering Long Blond Strand Of Hair At Crime Scene,"NEW YORK—Requesting the public come forward with any information they might have regarding the absolute bombshell, New York City homicide detectives announced Tuesday they were searching for a real knockout after discovering a long blond strand of hair at a murder scene. “We’ve asked all units to be on the lookout for a blond with the kind of curves that would make a man as dizzy as Schmeling after a one-two punch from Joe Louis,” said police lieutenant Michael Sasso, who stated that forensic technicians were analyzing a few fibers found at the scene that might have belonged to a slinky negligée, a tight blouse that doesn’t leave much to the imagination, or—if criminal profilers determine the suspect is the more sophisticated type—a little black number and not much else. “Our sketch artist has produced dozens and dozens of sketches of a real head-turner who’s got pouty lips, sultry eyes, and a set of gams that go from here to Poughkeepsie. If you spot a dame matching this description, we ask that you immediately call 911, and do not approach her. Seriously, don’t approach her. We already called dibs, buddy.” Later, while tracking down a lead, the homicide detectives reportedly got a real working over from a couple goons and were told to lay off the case by a heavyset man with silky, flowing locks of flaxen.",Political News,4/20/2021
Man Waiting For Curbside Order Pacing Sidewalk Like Expectant Father In Delivery Room,"CHICAGO—Looking as though he was on the verge of passing out from anxiety, local man Michael Cookson was reportedly waiting for his curbside sushi order Tuesday and pacing the sidewalk like an expectant father outside a delivery room. According to sources, a restless Cookson was seen striding back and forth across a 12-foot section of pavement just outside the doors of the restaurant, wiping his brow and muttering, “What’s taking so long? I hope everything is okay,” under his breath. Eyewitnesses confirmed Cookson appeared to be growing more and more agitated with the passing minutes, noting that at one point, the man had come to a sudden stop, rested his folded hands over his head, and let out a long, pained, deep breath as if he was considering charging into the back to see what was going on for himself. At press time, a server had emerged from the doors to inform Cookson there had been a terrible complication.",Political News,4/20/2021
Hike With Neighbors Through Ravine Enjoyable Despite Not Finding Missing Child,"COLUMBUS, OH—Smiling while recalling the “fantastic little outing,” local woman Olivia Curtis told reporters  that she enjoyed hiking with her neighbors through a densely forested ravine Tuesday despite failing to locate the missing child they were searching for. “It was so nice just to get out into nature, get some fresh air, and get to know some of the folks from our neighborhood a little better, even if we never did find that little girl,” said Curtis, who noted that the three-hour jaunt through the wooded area behind their houses had brought members of the makeshift search party closer together than any block party or backyard barbecue ever had. “While no one saw any sign of the kid, we did see a few chipmunks, not to mention some beautiful cherry trees that were in bloom and just about at their peak. Obviously, it’s horrible for anyone’s daughter to go missing like that, but at least we had great company! Plus, Doug and Barb, who were right next to Cheryl and I in the human chain, invited us over to watch the Cavs tonight, which should be a blast. And the best part is that we get to do it all over again at first light tomorrow!” While stressing that time spent with friends was priceless on its own, Curtis acknowledged that finding the child whom no one had heard from or seen in five days “sure would be the icing on the cake.”",Political News,4/20/2021
Woman Reassures Boyfriend That Just Because She’s Not Screaming Doesn’t Mean She’s Not Enjoying Roller Coaster,"ORLANDO—Explaining that being quiet didn’t indicate a lack of pleasure, Anna Wright assured her boyfriend Ted Ronson Monday that just because she wasn’t screaming, it didn’t mean she wasn’t enjoying the roller coaster they were on. “I don’t need to be writhing around and freaking out for me to be having a good time,” said Wright, clarifying that she was still getting excited even if she wasn’t hollering her head off. “I know in the movies or TV it seems like you have to be throwing your hands in the air and having your eyes roll back in your head, but for me it can manifest as a couple of small gasps or even just some heavy breathing.” At press time, a somewhat disappointed Ronson expressed his hope that going on a flume ride would get his girlfriend super wet.",Political News,4/20/2021
Rainforest Tree Remains Very Still In Hopes That Bulldozer Will Lose Interest And Drive Away,"VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA—As the heat and noise from the massive beast prowling nearby grew closer, a rainforest tree was reportedly remaining very still Monday in hopes that the bulldozer would lose interest and drive away. Sources reported that the jackwood tree remained completely immobile to ensure that it did not so much rustle a leaf and risk provoking a potentially fatal attack from the savage predator, and tried to make itself as small as possible in the belief that the massive piece of machinery might ignore it. In addition, the tree recalled a previous occasion when it had successfully remained still long enough for an encroaching bulldozer to eventually get bored and wander away, but had heard of other occasions when the bulldozer attacked trees regardless of their immobility and rampaged through the rainforest. Often these attacks came when the bulldozer was downwind of the tree and could be riled up by its scent, as the panicking tree reportedly realized was currently the case. At press time, the jackwood tree was reportedly considering trying to make a break for it and flee the bulldozer at the rate of a centimeter per century.",Political News,4/20/2021
FTC Rules Businesses Must Disclose Whether They Actually Cool Or Just Use Minimalist Branding,"WASHINGTON—Condemning businesses that use clean lines and unobtrusive colors to intentionally defraud customers, the Federal Trade Commission ruled Friday that companies must begin disclosing whether they are actually cool or are merely using minimalist branding to simulate coolness. “Too often, consumers have been deceived into thinking a brand is hip and fresh because they see a sans-serif font on a soft, neutral background,” said acting FTC  chair Rebecca Slaughter, who also decried the unfair practice in which businesses use one-word names with no explanation as to who they are or what they do, falsely suggesting a detached, unaffected attitude when in reality the brand isn’t cool at all. “We intend to crack down on organizations big and small that have willfully used all-lower-case letters and monochromatic palettes to mislead the public, which often will conclude a company is modern, original, and chill when it’s really just another consulting firm in the Bay Area, or some upscale juice service available in select metropolitan regions. Our investigation found that brands like Ritual, Marine Layer, and Summer Fridays take advantage of the fact that consumers can’t see far enough past a simple noun typed over a muted pink circle to determine that the products on offer are more expensive, less interesting versions of items that already exist. We are now requiring these companies to be up-front about not being as chic as their logos may suggest when they stamp a generic word like ‘spoon’ or ‘alpha’ onto a pastel background.” Slaughter followed up the announcement with a press conference in which the agency debuted a sleek new FTC seal set in the Helvetica font on a Dijon background.",Political News,4/20/2021
"‘Just Like A Fairy Tale,’ Gushes Woman Watching As Royal Corpse Tossed Into Furnace","WINDSOR, ENGLAND—Wiping joyful tears away from the corners of her eyes, local woman Tricia Ramsey reportedly gushed “Just like a fairy tale” Saturday while watching Prince Philip’s royal corpse being tossed into a furnace. “Oh, wow, this is just like every little girl’s dream,” said Ramsey, who was overcome by awe with just a tinge of longing as she witnessed a team of royal staffers  shove the Duke of Edinburgh’s body roughly inside the incinerator while scores of cheering, jubilant Britons across the nation raised pints while watching the televised event in pubs and waved Union Jack flags in the streets. “Look at that smoke! I can only hope one day my cadaver will go up in flames like that. What a day! I’m just so emotional, I know we won’t forget about this one soon.” At press time, Ramsey was singing “God Save The Queen” while trying to catch a piece of falling ash in her mouth.",Political News,4/20/2021
