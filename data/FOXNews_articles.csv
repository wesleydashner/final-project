     Former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murder, manslaughter in death of George Floyd A panel of jurorshasfoundformer Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvinguilty Tuesday on all three charges in connection with the May 2020 death of George Floyd, after one of the most closely watched criminal trials in recent memory. Chauvin, 45, was charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. With Americans on edge as they awaited the verdict, the jury announced that it has found him guilty across the board. His bail was immediately revoked and he was led away with his hands cuffed behind his back. Cheers and cars honking could be heard outside the Hennepin County Courthouse as the verdict was read. Chauvin's sentencing is scheduled for eight weeks from now, the judge said. He could be sent to prison for decades. It took the jury about 10 hours and 20 minutes to reach a decision, which was read late in the afternoon in a city on edge regarding the possibility of more unrest like that that erupted last spring. DEREK CHAUVIN CHARGES EXPLAINED: WHAT PROSECUTORS MUST PROVE The courthouse was ringed with concrete barriers and razor wire, and thousands of National Guard troops and law enforcement officers were brought in ahead of the verdict. Some businesses were boarded up with plywood. The jury was made up of seven women and five men.Six jurors were White, four were Black and two identifiedas multiracial. Jurors were sequestered, their whereabouts kept secret, during deliberations that began Monday afternoon. Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25, 2020 after Chauvin held his knee against his neck or upper body for nineminutes and 29 seconds, as a handcuffed Floydrepeatedly saidthat he could not breathe. LIVE UPDATES: CHAUVIN JURY REACHES A VERDICT ON SECOND DAY OF DELIBERATIONS Police were called to the area on that day for a report that Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes at a neighborhood convenience store, Cup Foods. His death prompted widespread protests, whichlasted months, and calls for an end to police brutality and systemic racism. During the trial, the jury heard from high-ranking Minneapolis police officials, loved onesof Floyd, bystanders, anofficer who also responded to the sceneand medical experts -- some of whompresented dueling opinions. The case boiled down to two key questions: whether Chauvin caused Floyd's death andwhether his actions were reasonable. Each charge required a different element of proof as to Chauvin's state of mind.

Williams was testifying about what he saw of Floyd's arrest. (Court TV via AP, Pool) For all three charges, prosecutors had to prove that Chauvin caused Floyd's death and that his use of force was unreasonable. Prosecutors didn't have to prove Chauvin’s restraint was the sole cause of Floyd's death, but only that his conduct was a ""substantial causal factor."" Chauvin is authorized to use force as a police officer, as long as that force is reasonable. The defense argued that the now-fired White officer acted reasonably and that the 46-year-old Floyd died of a heart condition andillegal drug use.

     Former Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin found guilty on all charges in George Floyd's death; 'The Five' reacts The jury found former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin guilty in the death of George Floyd on Tuesday, but the fight is not over for Chauvin’s defense team, which will likely use Rep. Maxine Waters’ comments on the case as one reason the trial was not fair. ""There’s so much and so many different directions for the defense to go,"" Randy Zelin, head of the criminal practice at Wilk Auslander LLP and an adjunct professor of law at Cornell University, told Fox News. The first step will be to file post-trial motions with the trial judge to have the case thrown out, which Zelin noted are typically summarily denied. Next comes the sentencing process, which includes an investigation conducted by the probation department and a comprehensive workup presented to the judge. Both the prosecution and defense teams will present their cases. The state has sought to have an aggravated sentence imposed via the Blakely motion. After the sentencing, the appeal time starts. Zelin said the defense will argue for appeal on the basis that Chauvin did not get a fair trial for a number of reasons, including pretrial publicity, failure to change the venue and intra-trial publicity – including Waters’ comments and even potentially comments made by President Biden. The defense will likely also bring up the fact that jury members saw the video before it was introduced into evidence, Zelin said, and that members were unfairly burdened by the idea that Minnesota would ""burn to the ground"" if Chauvin was not convicted. DEREK CHAUVIN TRIAL JUDGE SLAMS MAXINE WATERS' INFLAMMATORY COMMENTS As previously reported by Fox News, Chauvin’s attorney argued on Monday that Waters’ comments, in addition to other external factors, were grounds for a potential mistrial. ""And now that we have U.S. representatives … threatening acts of violence in relation to this specific case, it's mind boggling,"" Attorney Eric Nelson said, as he attempted to argue that the jury may have been unduly influenced by external factors. Judge Peter Cahill conceded with Nelson that ""Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned."" Cahill also said that he wished elected officials would stop referencing the case ""especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law"" so as to let the judicial process play out as intended. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Waters urged protesters in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, where Duante Wright was recently shot by a police officer, to ""stay in the street"" as she joined the protests on Saturday and violated the local curfew. ""We've got to stay in the street and we've got to get more active, we've got to get more confrontational,""Waters said, referencing a scenario where Chauvin is not convicted. ""We've got to make sure that they know that we mean business."" Biden on Tuesday said he was ""praying the verdict is the right verdict."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pointed to comments from both Biden and Waters as proof that a fair trial is sometimes ""difficult"" to carry out. ""It is certainly not helpful for a member of Congress, and even the president of the U.S. to appear to be weighing in in public, while the jury is trying to sort through this significant case,"" McConnell said. Chauvin was charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. He was found guilty on all three counts.

     The president says the guilty verdict 'sends a message,' but it's not enough on 'FOX News Primetime' Theguilty verdict in the murder trial of former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin""can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America,""President Biden and Vice President Harrissaid Tuesday. That march, they added, has too rarelydelivered ""basic accountability"" for Black Americans. America has a ""long history of systemic racism,"" they said, calling it a ""stain on the nation's soul."" A panel of jurors found Chauvin guilty on Tuesday on all three charges in connection with the May 2020 death of George Floyd— the Black man in Minnesota who died after he was seen on video – handcuffed – saying ""I can't breathe"" as Chauvin kneeled on Floyd's neck. JURY FINDS CHAUVIN GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES IN GEORGE FLOYD'S DEATH Floyd’s death sparked nationwide protests last spring and summer over police brutality against minorities and systemic racism. Chauvin, 45, was charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.After the jury announced the verdict, Chauvin’s bail was immediately revoked and he was led away with hands cuffed behind his back. Biden and Harris, following the verdict, took the podium at the White House. Harris, speaking first, thankingthe jury, and the Floyd family, saying the verdict brought""a sigh of relief"" but ""cannot take away the pain.""

       ""A measure of justice is not the same as equal justice,"" Harris said. ""This verdict brings us a step closer and the fact is we still have work to do.We still must reform the system."" Harris added:""Americahas a long history of systemic racism."" Biden then took the podium, saying Floyd's murder was one ""in the full light of day.""""It rippedthe blinders off for the whole world to see the systemic racism,"" Biden said. ""Systemic racism -- a stain on our nation’s soul."" ""The knee on the neck of justice for Black Americans -- profound fear and trauma, the pain, exhaustion that Black and Brown Americans experience everysingle day,"" Biden said. ""The murder of George Floyd launched a summer of protest we hadn't seen since the Civil Rights [era] in the '60s."" Biden said that the protests ""unified people of every race and generation in peace and with purpose to say, 'Enough, enough, enough of these senseless killings.'"" ""Thiscan be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America,"" he said. BIDEN TELLS FLOYD FAMILY 'NOW THERE'S SOME JUSTICE' AFTER CHAUVIN GUILTY VERDICT Biden toutedofficers for ""testifying against a fellow officer,"" saying they ""should be commended,"" and the jury who ""carried out their civic dutyin the midst of an extraordinary moment,under extraordinary pressure."" ""For so many, it feels like it took all of that for the judicial system to deliver just, just basic accountability,"" Biden said, adding that""racial disparities"" exist in ""policing and in our criminaljustice system more broadly."" Harris, during her remarks, pointed to the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which she introduced last summer -- along with fellowDemocratsSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Karen Bass of California -- to ""holdlaw enforcement accountable and buildtrust between law enforcement andcommunities."" ""This bill is part of George Floyd’s legacy,"" Harris said, urging the Senate to pass the bill ""not as a panacea for every problem,but as a start.""

       Biden, in referencingthe bill, calledfor congressional action, while saying that the leadership of the Justice Department was""fully committed to restoring trust between law enforcement and the community they are sworn to serve and protect."" Meanwhile, Biden said Floyd's ""legacy"" should be ""one of peace, not violence."" ""Peaceful expression of that legacy are inevitable and appropriate, but violent protest is not,"" Biden said. ""And there are those who will seek to exploit the raw emotions of the moment, agitators and extremists who have no interest in social justice, who seek to carry out violence, destroy property, fan the flames of hate and division-- who will do everything in their power to stop this country’s march toward racial justice."" He added: ""We can't let them succeed."" Biden said this was a time for the country ""to come together to unite as Americans."" ""We can never be any safe harbor for hate in America,"" the president said. The Housevoted along party lines last monthto pass the George Floyd Justice inPolicing Act. The wide-ranging bill would overhaul standards for police tactics and conduct at the federal level. Prominent measures include a federal ban on no-knock warrants and chokeholds, limits on qualified immunity shielding police from civil lawsuits, a framework to prevent racial profiling and the establishment of a national registry on allegations of police misconduct. The billis awaiting consideration in the Senate, where it is expected to face stiff opposition from GOP lawmakers.The House previously passed a version of the reform bill last June, just weeks after Floyd’s death prompted nationwide protests against police brutality. Republicans opposed the bill and it later stalled in the GOP-controlled Senate. Meanwhile, shortly after the verdict was delivered Tuesday afternoon, Biden and Harris called the Floyd family, celebrating the jury's decision. ""Nothing isgoing tomake it all better, but at leastnow there's some justice,"" Biden is heard saying on speaker phone in a video posted to Twitter on Tuesday by attorney Ben Crump. ""We're going to start to change now. We're going to start to change now."" Harris, during the call, said: ""This is a day of justice in America."" Harris added that ""in George’s name and memory we are going to make sure his legacy is in tact and that history will look back at this moment and know that this is an inflection moment."" ""He had to sacrifice so much and your family did too,"" Harris said. ""But we believe, with your leadership and, and the president that we have in the White House,that we’re going to make something good come out of this tragedy, OK?"" Biden, as the jury began deliberations, said he was ""praying the verdict is the right verdict."" Biden, on Monday, spoke to the Floyd family after the jury was sequestered, and said he understands what it is like ""to go through loss."" ""They're a good family, and they're calling for peace and tranquility, no matter what that verdict is,"" Biden said. ""I'm praying that verdict is the right verdict, which I think it's overwhelming, in my view. I wouldn't say that unless the jury was sequestered now."" Biden also called the Floyd family last year – soon after Floyd's death, which came during the 2020 presidential election campaign – and later the then-presidential candidate traveled to Houston to meet with the family and express is condolences. (Floyd lived in Houston before moving to Minneapolis.)

     FOX News' Trey Gowdy, Lawrence Jones and Martha MacCallum analyze the trials verdict on 'The Five' The guilty verdict delivered by a jury on charges brought against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd on Tuesday is progress, Democrats say, but it is not justice. President Barack Obama former First Lady Michelle Obama issued a statement following the jury’s verdict on Tuesday calling it a ""necessary step"" but acknowledging it is not a sufficient one. ""In this case, at least, we have our answer. But if we’re being honest with ourselves, we know that true justice is about much more than a single verdict in a single trial,"" the Obamas said. ""True justice requires that we come to terms with the fact that Black Americans are treated differently, every day. It requires us to recognize that millions of our friends, family, and fellow citizens live in fear that their next encounter with law enforcement could be their last.""

     FOX News Correspondent Matt Finn joins 'Special Report' with the latest from Minneapolis Following former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin’s conviction on all counts in the death of George Floyd, Democratic New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the murder trial outcome ""is not justice."" Chauvin was convicted of second- and third-degree murder as well as second-degree manslaughter after Floyd died in police custody on May 25, 2020. Police brutality charges are rare to begin with – and convictions are even more so. But the Democratic socialist has long called for defunding police and ending qualified immunity, a principle that often prevents officers from facing civil liability for certain conduct within the line of duty. Despite prosecutors’ success at trial, Ocasio-Cortez noted that ""a family had to lose a son, brother and father; that a teenage girl had to film and post a murder, that millions across the country had to organize and march just for George Floyd to be seen and valued is not justice."" DEREK CHAUVIN VERDICT: GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES ""And this verdict is not a substitute for policy change,"" she added. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, another far-left Democrat from New York City who has been dubbed a new member of ""the Squad"" in Congress, also found the verdict insufficient. ""We've known Chauvin was guilty since the second we saw him murder George Floyd on film — but we also know of the racism inherent in our [jail] and policing systems,"" he tweeted. ""This verdict doesn't change that racism, or the work ahead needed to transform those systems to serve us."" Rep. Ilhan Omar, a fellow Squad member who represents a district in the state of Minnesota, also called on additional measures following the trial – ranging from legalizing recreational marijuana to allowing felons to vote and establishing an ""independent agency"" to investigate police brutality allegations. Still, she welcomed the verdict. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""This feels different for our community, justice feels new and long overdue,"" she tweeted. ""Rejoice, my beloved community. Grateful to @AGEllison, jurors, and everyone who made this possible.""

FAQ - Updated Privacy Policy 'Kudlow' host says rioting turns into an 'economic issue' when businesses are destroyed President Biden and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., putting pressure on the jury in the Derek Chauvin trial is ""absolutely crazy,"" ""Kudlow"" host Larry Kudlow argued on Tuesday. Both the president and congresswoman spoke up about the case’s verdict before it even occurred, Waters pushing for more violence if the outcome did not meet expectations. LARRY KUDLOW: Maxine Waters calling for confrontation, President Biden praying the verdict is [right] is irresponsible – statements that, frankly, could be used in an appeal for jury tampering. Saying that the verdict should be appropriate, saying the verdict should be in the family, all this stuff is just utter nonsense. The president overstepping not as badly as Waters, but he's overstepping too. Jury votes wrong – rioting. Isn't that what she's saying? If there's any kind of acquittal, there should be rioting in the streets? Isn't that what she's really saying? Biden is somewhat less clear, but he, too, putting pressure on the jury, they're putting pressure on the jury. This is crazy, absolutely crazy. Of course, in most of these urban riots, the people who are hurt the most are minorities and African-American small business owners. So this becomes an economic issue, doesn't it? Again and again in the past year, provocateurs like Maxine Waters, Antifa, Black Lives Matter, inciting violent rioting, leading to tragic deaths, whether it's New York, Washington, Chicago, Minneapolis, Portland, inevitably, inevitably, it’s Black Americans that suffer the most. And that is a tragedy. WATCH LARRY KUDLOW'S FULL MONOLOGUE HERE Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes. Real-time quotes provided by BATS BZX Real-Time Price.
