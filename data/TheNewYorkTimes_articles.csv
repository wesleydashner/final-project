Biden and Harris on the Chauvin Trial VerdictThe president and the vice president addressed the nation on Tuesday evening.,"Here is a transcript of Vice President Kamala Harris’s and President Biden’s remarks to the nation on Tuesday evening: VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Good evening. First I want to thank the jury for their service and I want to thank Mr. Floyd’s family for your steadfastness. Today, we feel a sigh of relief. Still, it cannot take away the pain. A measure of justice isn’t the same as equal justice. This verdict brings us a step closer, and the fact is we still have work to do. We still must reform the system. Last summer, together with Senator Cory Booker and Representative Karen Bass, I introduced the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. This bill would hold law enforcement accountable and help build trust between law enforcement and our communities. This bill is part of George Floyd’s legacy. The president and I will continue to urge the Senate to pass this legislation, not as a panacea for every problem but as a start. This work is long overdue. America has a long history of systemic racism. Black Americans and Black men in particular have been treated throughout the course of our history as less than human. Black men are fathers and brothers and sons and uncles and grandfathers and friends and neighbors. Their lives must be valued in our education system, in our health care system, in our housing system, in our economic system, in our criminal justice system, in our nation. Full stop. Because of smartphones, so many Americans have now seen the racial injustice that Black Americans have known for generations. The racial injustice that we have fought for generations. That my parents protested in the 1960s. That millions of us, Americans of every race, protested last summer. Here’s the truth about racial injustice: It is not just a Black America problem or a people-of-color problem. It is a problem for every American. It is keeping us from fulfilling the promise of liberty and justice for all. And it is holding our nation back from realizing our full potential. We are all a part of George Floyd’s legacy. And our job now is to honor it and to honor him. Thank you. And now it is my great honor to introduce the president of the United States, Joe Biden. PRESIDENT BIDEN: Today, a jury in Minnesota found former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin guilty on all counts in the murder of George Floyd last May. It was a murder in the full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see the systemic racism the vice president just referred to. The systemic racism is a stain on our nation’s soul. The knee on the neck of justice for Black Americans. Profound fear and trauma. The pain, the exhaustion that Black and brown Americans experience every single day. The murder of George Floyd launched a summer of protests we hadn’t seen since the civil rights era in the ’60s. Protests that unified people of every race and generation in peace and with purpose to say enough. Enough. Enough of the senseless killings. Today — today’s verdict is a step forward. I just spoke with the governor of Minnesota, who thanked me for the close work with his team. And I also spoke with George Floyd’s family again. Remarkable family of extraordinary courage. Nothing can ever bring their brother, their father back. But this can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America. Let’s also be clear that such a verdict is also much too rare. For so many people it seems like it took a unique and extraordinary convergence of factors. A brave young woman with a smartphone camera, a crowd that was traumatized. Traumatized witnesses, a murder that lasts almost 10 minutes in broad daylight for ultimately the whole world to see. Officers standing up and testifying against a fellow officer instead of just closing ranks, which should be commended. A jury who heard the evidence, carried out their civic duty in the midst of an extraordinary moment under extraordinary pressure. For so many, it feels like it took all of that for the judicial system to deliver a just — just basic accountability. We saw how traumatic and exhausting just watching the trial was for so many people. Think about it, those of you who are listening. Think about how traumatic it was for you. You weren’t there, you didn’t know any of the people. But it was difficult. Especially for the witnesses who had to relive that day. It’s a trauma on top of the fear so many people of color live with every day, when they go to sleep at night and pray for the safety of themselves and their loved ones. Again, as we saw in this trial from the fellow police officers who testified, most men and women who wear the badge serve their communities honorably. But those few who fail to meet that standard must be held accountable, and they were today. One was. No one should be above the law, and today’s verdict sends that message. But it’s not enough. We can’t stop here. In order to deliver real change and reform, we can and we must do more to reduce the likelihood that a tragedy like this will ever happen to occur again. To ensure the Black and brown people — or anyone — so they don’t fear the interactions with law enforcement, that they don’t have to wake up knowing that they can lose their very life in the course of just living their life. They don’t have to worry about whether their sons or daughters will come home after a grocery store run or just walking down the street or driving their car or playing in the park or just sleeping at home. And this takes acknowledging and confronting head on systemic racism and the racial disparities that exist in policing and in our criminal justice system more broadly. You know, state and local government and law enforcement needs to step up, but so does the federal government. That’s why I’ve appointed the leadership of the Justice Department that I have that is fully committed to restoring trust between law enforcement and the community they are sworn to serve and protect. I have complete confidence in the attorney general — general Garland’s leadership and commitment. I’ve also nominated two key Justice Department nominees, Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clarke, who are eminently qualified, highly respected lawyers who have spent their entire careers fighting to advance racial equity and justice. Vanita and Kristen have the experience and the skill necessary to advance our administration’s priorities to root out unconstitutional policing and reform our criminal justice system, and they deserve to be confirmed. We also need Congress to act. George Floyd was murdered almost a year ago. There’s meaningful police reform legislation in his name. You just heard the vice president speak of it, she helped write it, legislation to tackle systemic misconduct in police departments, to restore trust between law enforcement and the people they’re entrusted to serve and protect. But it shouldn’t take a whole year to get this done. In my conversations with the Floyd family, and I spoke with them again today, I assured them we’re going to continue to fight for the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act so I can sign it into law as quickly as possible. There’s more to do. Finally, it’s the work we do every day to change hearts and minds as well as laws and policies. That’s the work we have to do. Only then will full justice and full equality be delivered to all Americans. And that’s what I just discussed with the Floyd family. The guilty verdict does not bring back George, but through the family’s pain, they’re finding purpose so George’s legacy will not be just about his death, but about what we must do in his memory. I also spoke to Gianna, George’s young daughter, again. When I met her last year, I’ve said this before, at George’s funeral, I told her how brave I thought she was. And I sort of knelt down to hold her hand. I said: “Daddy’s looking down on you. He’s so proud.” She said to me then, I’ll never forget it, “Daddy changed the world.” And I told her this afternoon, “Daddy did change the world.” Let that be his legacy, a legacy of peace, nonviolence, justice. Peaceful expression of that legacy are inevitable and appropriate, but violent protest is not. And there are those who will seek to exploit the raw emotions of the moment, agitators and extremists who have no interest in social justice, who seek to carry out violence, destroyed property, fan the flames of hate and division, who’ll do everything in their power to stop this country’s march toward racial justice. We can’t let them succeed. This is a time for this country to come together, to unite as Americans. There can never be any safe harbor for hate in America. I’ve said it many times: The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push and pull for more than 240 years, a tug of war between the American ideal that we’re all created equal and the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart. At our best, the American ideal wins out. So we can’t leave this moment or look away thinking our work is done. We have to look at it as we did for those 9 minutes and 29 seconds. We have to listen: “I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe.” Those are George Floyd’s last words. We can’t let those words die with him. We have to keep hearing those words. We must not turn away. We can’t turn away. We have a chance to begin to change the trajectory in this country. It’s my hope and prayer that we live up to the legacy. May God bless you and may God bless George Floyd and his family. Thank you for taking the time to be here. This could be a moment of significant change. Thank you.",Political News,4/20/2021
"Biden Calls Chauvin Verdict a ‘Much Too Rare’ Moment of JusticePresident Biden has been outspoken about George Floyd’s death, and on Tuesday he called it “murder in full light of day.”By Katie Rogers","WASHINGTON — President Biden called a guilty verdict in the murder trial of the former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin on Tuesday a potential “giant step forward in the march toward justice in America,” but he also called the jury’s decision a “much too rare” step for Black Americans who have been killed or abused during interactions with the police. “It was a murder in the full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see,” the president said of the killing of George Floyd, who died after Mr. Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes, and whose death ignited nationwide protests. “For so many, it feels like it took all of that for the judicial system to deliver a just — just basic accountability.” Mr. Biden assumed the presidency during a national reckoning over race and has staked his political legacy around a promise of racial equality, which includes an overhaul of policing. He has been outspoken about Mr. Floyd’s death, saying it was a “wake-up call” for the United States. The president delivered his remarks to the nation hours after taking the unusual step of weighing in on the Chauvin trial’s outcome before the jury came back with a decision, and after telling reporters that he was “praying” for the “right verdict.” Amid a series of recent police shootings and other violent episodes over the course of the trial, Mr. Biden has repeatedly called on Congress to pass an ambitious policing overhaul bill, named for Mr. Floyd. On Tuesday evening, both he and Vice President Kamala Harris, who as a senator helped to write the bill, reiterated that plea to lawmakers. “Here’s the truth about racial injustice,” said Ms. Harris, who took the lectern before Mr. Biden. “It is not just a Black America problem or a people of color problem. It is a problem for every American. It is keeping us from fulfilling the promise of liberty and justice for all. And it is holding our nation back from realizing our full potential.” Just before the verdict was announced, the White House canceled a speech that Mr. Biden was to deliver on his infrastructure plan so that he could watch the proceedings alongside Ms. Harris and a group of aides in his private dining room near the Oval Office. The jury’s deliberations had been closely tracked throughout the day: In the minutes before the verdict’s delivery, White House aides were seen sprinting through the West Wing, phones in hand, and setting up a lectern in the Cross Hall, where the president and vice president would later speak. Just after the verdict was announced, the president spoke on the phone with members of Mr. Floyd’s family. “We’re all so relieved,” the president said to a group of people that included Ben Crump, the Floyd family’s lawyer. “I’m anxious to see you guys, I really am.” Mr. Biden can trace his political success, in part, to how he responded to the nationwide protests that rose up after Mr. Floyd’s death. Last June, as President Donald J. Trump stoked tensions on Twitter, calling the protests a result of the “radical left” and threatening to send in the National Guard, Mr. Biden traveled to Houston with his wife, Jill Biden, to meet with Mr. Floyd’s relatives. The hour he spent with the Floyd family effectively created a split-screen with Mr. Trump that bolstered his war chest and added momentum to his campaign. “I won’t fan the flames of hate,” Mr. Biden said at the time. “I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country — not use them for political gain.” Last week, Mr. Biden abandoned a campaign promise to establish a police oversight commission during his first 100 days in office, and administration officials have provided few details about how far the president will go to combat racism in policing. Instead, the Biden administration has embraced the Floyd bill, which would combat racial discrimination in policing but, given the slim majority held by Senate Democrats and the amount of Republican opposition, it is unlikely to become law. Passed by House Democrats in March, the bill would address policies that are at the center of the debate over race and policing. It would ban chokeholds and eliminate existing protections under qualified immunity, which shields officials who have been accused of violating others’ constitutional rights. It would also create a national registry to track police officers who have engaged in misconduct. On Tuesday evening, Mr. Biden used the podium, and any momentum caused by the ruling, to again present a case to the public for the bill. “George Floyd was murdered a year ago,” the president said. “There is meaningful police reform legislation under his name. You just heard the vice president speak of it — she helped write it.”",Political News,4/20/2021
"House Democrats Defeat G.O.P. Attempt to Censure Maxine WatersRepublicans sought to use the Black congresswoman’s comments to racial justice protesters as a political weapon, claiming she had incited violence and daring Democrats to stand by her. They did.By Catie Edmondson","WASHINGTON — Democrats on Tuesday defeated an effort by Representative Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican, to censure Representative Maxine Waters for suggesting that racial justice protesters should “get more confrontational” if the Derek Chauvin jury did not return a guilty verdict. In an episode designed by Republicans for maximum political advantage, Democrats stayed united in a 216-to-210 vote to quash Mr. McCarthy’s resolution to formally rebuke Ms. Waters, a prominent Black congresswoman who is a frequent target of insults by conservatives. The House vote unfolded hours before the jury found Mr. Chauvin, a white police officer, guilty of murdering George Floyd, an unarmed Black man. Mr. McCarthy said Ms. Waters, 82, the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, had incited violence when she rallied in Brooklyn Center, Minn., over the weekend with demonstrators protesting the death of Daunte Wright, a Black man, at the hands of a white police officer. Asked on Saturday what protesters should do if no guilty verdict were reached in the Chauvin trial, Ms. Waters said: “We’ve got to stay on the street, and we’ve got to get more active. We’ve got to get more confrontational. We’ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business.” Ms. Waters, a 15-term Californian, later said she had been referring to civil rights-era demonstrations, which used tactics of civil disobedience, and Democratic leaders stood behind her. But Mr. McCarthy — who this year declined to punish Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, who had previously endorsed killing Speaker Nancy Pelosi — saw an opening to try to put politically vulnerable Democrats on the spot. He portrayed Ms. Waters’s remarks as condoning violence and effectively dared her colleagues to back her by putting the matter to a vote, a perilous proposition given that Democrats’ razor-thin margin of control in the House left almost no room for defections. Still, Democrats held together. Ms. Pelosi, also of California, told reporters on Monday that Ms. Waters had no reason to apologize for her remarks, and she could be seen whipping votes on the House floor on Tuesday. “I love my colleagues and they love me,” Ms. Waters said after the vote. “I don’t want to do anything to hurt them or hurt their chances for re-election. I will make sure that they are comfortable with my kind of advocacy so that we can all be sure that we can do the right thing.” After the measure’s defeat, Republicans lost no time in mounting the political attacks that it had been intended to feed. Mr. McCarthy issued a news release saying that Democrats had “decided to stand on the side of violence instead of the law.” House Republicans’ campaign arm blasted out news releases to the districts of endangered Democrats claiming they had voted “for violence.” In a tweet on Tuesday, Mr. McCarthy called Ms. Waters’s actions “beneath the dignity of this institution,” and said that “they raised the potential for violence, directed lawlessness, and may have interfered with a co-equal branch of government.” His resolution cited at length comments made by Judge Peter A. Cahill, who presided over Mr. Chauvin’s case and who said on Monday in an unusual aside that Ms. Waters’s comments may have given the defense an opening to overturn the trial on appeal. Judge Cahill said he wished “elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law.” Mr. McCarthy’s effort was particularly striking after he declined to take any action against Ms. Greene, who has referred to the deadly Capitol riot on Jan. 6 as a “1776 moment.” Democrats denounced his move as hypocritical because he has also not condemned inflammatory speech used by colleagues in his party around the time of the riot. “Clean up your mess, Kevin,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the No. 4 House Democrat, said at a news conference before the vote on Tuesday. “Sit this one out. You’ve got no credibility.” The attempt to censure Ms. Waters resurrected tensions between Democrats and Republicans in the House, where many Democrats are still reluctant to work with those who had cast doubt on the legitimacy of President Biden’s victory or encouraged their supporters to march on the Capitol. In the immediate aftermath of the storming of Congress, some Democrats had clamored to censure or even expel Republican members who used bellicose language in the days leading up to the assault, but those efforts went nowhere. Some Democrats who were unhappy with Ms. Waters’s comments feared that moving ahead with censuring her would unleash an endless tide of retributive measures, a concept that Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, invoked in a speech before the vote. “If confrontation is subject to sanction, then we’re going to have a lot of people on your side of the aisle who we believe are confrontational every day,” he said, adding that Democrats had not advanced a number of similar resolutions targeting Republicans. “This makes it harder, however, not to proceed on numerous resolutions on my side of the aisle,” Mr. Hoyer said. The situation was reminiscent of the one Mr. McCarthy faced when Democrats pressured him to punish Ms. Greene for her past comments. Democrats moved unilaterally to strip her of her committee seats, citing the Republican leader’s unwillingness to do so — an argument that Mr. McCarthy parroted on Monday. “Speaker Pelosi is ignoring Waters’ behavior,” Mr. McCarthy wrote on Twitter on Monday. “That’s why I am introducing a resolution to censure Rep. Waters for these dangerous comments.” The House rarely moves to censure lawmakers. Steve King, a former Republican congressman from Iowa, for example, was never censured for a litany of racist comments he made while in office, including claiming that nonwhite people had not contributed as much as white people had to civilization and that “mixing cultures will not lead to a higher quality of life but a lower one.” Charles B. Rangel, a former Democratic congressman from New York, was the last House lawmaker to be censured, in 2010, for a litany of transgressions related to financial corruption.",Political News,4/20/2021
On PoliticsThe Country’s Evolving Marijuana DebateDemocrats at the national level increasingly see the drug as a unity issue.By Giovanni Russonello,"Six years ago, when John Fetterman first ran for the Democratic Senate nomination in Pennsylvania, he spoke out about his support for legalizing marijuana. He was the only candidate to do so. But in just a few short years, the picture has changed. “The true crazy fringe perspective is ‘Reefer Madness’ now — the overwhelming majority of people want this,” Mr. Fetterman, now the state’s lieutenant governor, said in a phone interview on Tuesday. He was taking a brief pause between public events in celebration of April 20, a.k.a. 420, the unofficial national holiday for weed smokers. “People are over it already,” he added. “They’re like, ‘Why hasn’t this happened? What are we waiting for?’ Even Republicans.” Mr. Fetterman is campaigning for the Democratic Senate nomination again ahead of the 2022 election, and his camp has been even bolder this time about its support for legalizing pot. It’s one of the core components of his platform. The campaign has been selling T-shirts festooned with cannabis leaves and green “420” text alongside Mr. Fetterman’s name. Outside his office in Harrisburg, he frequently flies flags in support of marijuana legalization (alongside Pride flags) — in defiance of a bill passed last year by the Republican state legislature that sought to stop him from displaying them. Yesterday, Mr. Fetterman’s Senate campaign team welcomed Jordan Rogers, a 29-year-old activist and organizer, as its official “cannabis coalition leader.” Mr. Rogers said that he’d been struck by Mr. Fetterman’s decision in 2019 to tour all 67 counties in the state to discuss marijuana legalization. “He got a lot of traction in the center of the state, majority red,” Mr. Rogers said. As the campaign’s point person on pot, Mr. Rogers is “trying to build a coalition of everyone,” he said. “I need Democrats, Republicans, independents, farmers, folks incarcerated, users in general — it’s such a broad coalition.” In fact, Democrats at the national level are increasingly seeing marijuana as a unity issue, as more than two-thirds of Americans now support legalizing pot, according to various polls — including at least about half of Republicans. Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, took to the Senate floor today to reaffirm his support for legalizing recreational marijuana nationwide, and talked up a bill he’s drafting with Senators Cory Booker and Ron Wyden that would do exactly that. “Today is what you might call a very unofficial American holiday: 4/20,” Mr. Schumer said with a grin. “It’s as appropriate a time as any to take a hard look at our laws that have over-criminalized the use of marijuana and put it on par with heroin, LSD and other narcotics that bear little or no resemblance in their effects either on individuals or on society more broadly,” he added. Last year, he encouraged Democratic candidates to run in support of legalization, seeing it as catnip for the party’s young and progressive base but also popular with moderates and independents. It’s also a racial equity issue, as Mr. Schumer detailed in his floor speech today. “The war on drugs has too often been a war on people, particularly people of color,” he said. In an interview with the website Marijuana Moment, he stressed the importance of equity. “We certainly think that we ought to make sure that the communities that have been most affected by these draconian laws get the benefits here,” he said, “and we want to make sure that there are reinvestment initiatives and it doesn’t all go to the big shots — that smaller businesses and minority businesses get a chance to be involved once marijuana is legalized.” Last month New York became the 15th state (in addition to Washington, D.C.) to legalize recreational pot use. The bill that Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed includes extensive provisions to address issues of racial equity. It not only expunges past convictions for marijuana-related offenses, but it also guarantees that 40 cents of every dollar in tax revenue from pot sales will go toward the minority communities that have been hardest hit by the consequences of drug enforcement. Congress is on the move, too. On Monday, the House easily passed a bill that would eliminate federal laws that make it a crime for banks to do business with marijuana companies in states that have legalized the weed trade; 106 Republicans joined a united Democratic conference in voting for the bill. But Mr. Schumer has indicated that he’s loath to pass a smaller bill, when what he’s really aiming for is all-out legalization. “I’ve always been of the view that while certainly we have to deal with the banking and financial issues that we should do them together with legalization,” he told Marijuana Moment. The one major Democratic figure who has not yet come around on legalizing weed is the most prominent of them all: President Biden. He said on the campaign trail that he would support decriminalizing it but that he felt further study was needed before he’d be comfortable legalizing it completely. Asked about legalization last month, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said the president’s stance “has not changed.” As you might remember reading in this newsletter, the Biden White House recently fired five staff members at least partly because of their past use of marijuana. Mr. Biden, who was an architect of some of the most punitive legislation passed during the war on drugs, has been slow to match the Democratic Party’s change of heart on marijuana policy. Bonita Bo Money, the founder of the National Diversity and Inclusion Cannabis Alliance, said her group and others that had supported Biden’s presidential campaign last year were waiting on him to fully get behind legalization. “It’s not moving the way that we think that it should,” she said of the administration’s stance. By the same token, Ms. Money said she was wary of legalization happening too quickly, emphasizing the importance of developing a robust plan to create a pipeline into the cannabis industry for people in communities of color. Before the Biden administration gets behind legalization, she said, she hoped it would create “a good social equity program.” “We need to have ownership,” Ms. Money said, referring to racial minorities. “We don’t just need folks to work in the industry, we need to have folks running the cannabis industry.”",Political News,4/20/2021
"Senators Debating Federal Voting Laws Scrutinize Georgia StatuteDemocrats pushing a giant federal elections overhaul summoned leaders from the state, which has passed new voting restrictions, to spar over Republican efforts.By Nicholas Fandos","Senate Democrats on Tuesday renewed their push for a national expansion of voting rights, summoning leaders from the battleground state of Georgia to help build a public case that Congress should intervene to lower state barriers to voting. At a heated hearing on Capitol Hill, senators quizzed elected officials, academics and advocates on the state’s new election law and dozens of others like it introduced in Republican statehouses since the 2020 election that would restrict ballot access. Their lead witness was Stacey Abrams, the Georgia voting rights activist who has arguably done more than any other Democrat to frame her party’s views of voting issues. Over four hours of testimony, Ms. Abrams argued that Republican-led states like hers across the country were witnessing “a resurgence of Jim Crow-style voter suppression measures” targeting voters of color. She accused Republicans of acting with “racial animus” to tilt the electorate in their favor after former President Donald J. Trump lost Georgia and baselessly claimed he had been the victim of election fraud. She warned that decades of gains could be rolled back if Congress did not step in. “When the fundamental right to vote is left to the political ambitions and prejudices of state actors, ones who rely on suppression to maintain power, federal intercession stands as the appropriate remedy,” Ms. Abrams said. Though the hearing before the Judiciary Committee was not specifically tied to legislation, it was part of a push by Democrats to use their hold in Washington to advance a pair of major voting bills that could counter hundreds of restrictive proposals in the states. The first is a gigantic national elections overhaul, known as H.R. 1, that would force states to expand early voting and mail-in balloting, mandate automatic voter registration and neuter restrictive voter identification laws, among other measures. The second bill, named after the civil rights icon John Lewis, would restore a key enforcement provision in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that made it harder for states to target voters of color. It was struck down in 2013 by the Supreme Court. Republicans oppose both bills, but have trained their ire most directly on the election overhaul, which also includes a new public campaign financing system and a revamp of the Federal Election Commission. On Tuesday, they called it a gross federal overreach intended to help Democrats consolidate power, rejected accusations of racism and renewed vows to help defeat it in the evenly divided Senate. “H.R. 1 is not about righting wrongs,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. “It’s about power.” In a sign of how polarized the debate over voting has become, the two parties even sparred over the title of the hearing itself. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and the chairman of the panel, had labeled it “Jim Crow 2021: The Latest Assault on the Right to Vote.” Republicans called that historically inaccurate and accused Democrats — including President Biden — of cheapening the stain of violent racial oppression by comparing it to voting laws of today. “It’s disgusting and offensive to compare the actual voter suppression and violence of that era that we grew up in with a state law that only asks people to show their ID,” said Representative Burgess Owens, Republican of Utah, adding that he had “actually experienced Jim Crow laws” as a child in the South. Mr. Durbin conceded that Jim Crow “at its worst was more violent than the situation we face today.” But he insisted the goal was much the same. “The bottom-line question, which we are addressing in this hearing, is whether there is a design or intent in legislation that is being passed in many states, including the state of Georgia, to limit or restrict the rights to vote of minority populations,” Mr. Durbin said. “I think that goes without saying.” Republicans’ unified opposition spells certain trouble for any significant federal voting legislation. Democrats would have to persuade all 50 of their senators to vote for the bill and create a carve-out in Senate rules to pass it with just a simple majority, relying on Vice President Kamala Harris’s tiebreaking vote. But for now, Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, has rejected that approach and called for bipartisan negotiations. Democrats’ attempts to renew the Voting Rights Act appear to face odds just as steep. Republicans no longer believe it necessary to restore the stricken provision, which required federal approval of changes to voting procedures in parts of the country with a history of discrimination. Without it, voting rights advocates say they have seen a proliferation of restrictive state voting laws like Georgia’s and must spend years in court trying to undo statutes that run afoul of the Constitution. “Litigation is a blunt instrument,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, the president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. “What pre-clearance gave us was to get out ahead of voter discrimination before it happened.” Republicans repeatedly turned to their own witnesses to push back on Democrats’ proposals, including Bill Gardner, New Hampshire’s long-serving top elections official and a Democrat. Mr. Gardner argued that his party’s attempted overhaul would backfire. “Why should we be made to be like California in particular or other states?” Mr. Gardner said. “We have a way of doing it that works for the people of New Hampshire. The turnout is the proof that it works, and this kind of federal legislation is harmful to our way of voting.” Jan Jones, the Republican speaker pro tempore of the Georgia House, mounted an energetic defense of her state’s new election law, saying that Republicans were merely “making it easier to vote and harder to cheat.” She said a provision barring third-party groups from providing food and water to voters waiting in line to cast their ballots was not a draconian tactic to suppress turnout, but an attempt to stop activists and candidates from using food and other goodies to sway voters. A New York Times analysis identified 16 provisions in the Georgia law that either hinder people’s ability to vote or shift power to the Republican-controlled legislature. Republican senators appeared just as eager to directly question Ms. Abrams, a Democratic star who may run again for governor in Georgia next year. Mr. Graham and Senator John Cornyn of Texas peppered her with questions that sought to portray her assertions about voter identification laws as contradictory, and her condemnation of Georgia’s statute as hypocritical. “So voter ID is sometimes racist, sometimes not racist?” Mr. Cornyn asked, in a lengthy exchange. “The intent always matters, sir, and that is the point of this conversation,” Ms. Abrams responded, saying that she supported some voter ID laws. “That is the point of the Jim Crow narrative. That Jim Crow did not simply look at the activities, it looked at the intent.” Polling shows that the public generally supports such laws, but voting rights advocates argue they can make it harder for some people of color to vote. Mr. Cornyn kept rephrasing the question. Ms. Abrams pushed back. “Senator, I am happy to respond to your questions, but if you are going to mischaracterize my responses, that’s inappropriate,” she said. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, pinned blame on Ms. Abrams for Major League Baseball’s decision to move this summer’s All-Star Game from Georgia, saying her public criticism of the voting bill had played a “central role” in a decision that could cost her state economically. Ms. Abrams vehemently disagreed, saying she had opposed the league’s move, but would stand by anyone defending the right to vote. “To me, one day of games is not worth losing our democracy,” she said.",Political News,4/20/2021
"Bush Says G.O.P. Has Become ‘to Some Degree Nativist’The former president also assailed the Trump-era Republican Party as “isolationist, protectionist,” and expressed concern about the fate of girls in Afghanistan if the Taliban take over.By Glenn Thrush","Former President George W. Bush stepped back into the political fray on Tuesday with a pointed rebuke of the Trump-era Republican Party, putting aside his usual silence on politics to air his unhappiness with the party’s direction on issues including immigration and trade. “I would describe it as isolationist, protectionist and, to a certain extent, nativist,” Mr. Bush said in an interview on NBC’s “Today” show on Tuesday, after he was asked to assess the state of the party. Mr. Bush had been careful to keep a relatively low profile in recent years, but he has re-emerged to promote a new book of oil paintings and vignettes celebrating the contributions of prominent immigrants, in hopes, he said, of “elevating” the discourse. The 43rd president, while aware of his limited ability to influence a party that long ago broke with many of his principles and came to distance itself from his record in office, is nonetheless intent, associates said, on making a case for reviving his more inclusive, pro-business brand of “compassionate” conservatism and supporting Republicans who want to move past former President Donald J. Trump. “I do feel that he recognizes that the party has drifted away from the core principles that he stood for,” said Andrew H. Card Jr., his White House chief of staff from 2001 to 2006 and a longtime friend of the Bush family. “I think he has maintained a lot of discipline not to opine on every little matter, but I think he now recognizes that this is a bruised nation, and he wants to help heal it.” For all the familiar flashes of self-deprecating humor, Mr. Bush is agitated and alarmed by the state of the nation. The Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol represented “something of a breaking point” for him, Mr. Card said. “I cried, and the former president, he cried, too,” Mr. Card said, speaking of that day. In the interview on Tuesday, Mr. Bush expressed his disgust at the pro-Trump mob that stormed the Capitol, but kept to his practice of not calling out Mr. Trump by name. “It kind of made me sick — not kind of made me sick, it did make me sick,” he said. Mr. Bush, who left office in 2009 with low approval ratings stemming from the Iraq war and the financial crisis, has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump, who lashed out at him during the 2016 presidential campaign and suggested Mr. Bush should have been impeached for providing false intelligence in the lead-up to the conflict. One of the factors that has kept Mr. Bush from weighing in more frequently during the Trump years, two people close to him said, was his concern that his statements could be used against his nephew George P. Bush, a Republican official in Texas, who has ambitions for seeking higher office in a state where Mr. Trump remains popular. This would be a consequential year for Mr. Bush, whose youthful brashness has receded with his hairline, even without the chaos of the election and its aftermath. Two weeks after the attack on Capitol, Mr. Bush quietly marked the 20th anniversary of his first inauguration, in which he called for bipartisanship — after waging a bare-knuckles battle during the Florida recount to win the White House over his Democratic opponent, Al Gore. Later this year comes a second, and more painful, moment: the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a date President Biden has chosen as his deadline for the complete withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. Mr. Biden consulted Mr. Bush and former President Barack Obama before announcing his decision to bring the American presence in the war to an end. It is not clear what counsel, if any, Mr. Bush offered Mr. Biden, but in the NBC interview, Mr. Bush expressed concerns about a full withdrawal, especially the potential effects on women and girls in Afghanistan, whose rights had been severely limited under Taliban rule before the American invasion. “My first reaction was ‘wow, these girls are going to have real trouble with the Taliban,’” he said. “I think the administration hopes that the girls are going to be OK through diplomacy. We’ll find out. All I know is the Taliban, when they had the run of the place, they were brutal. Brutal.” On immigration, Mr. Card said the former president “still has the will to ensure that there is a path to citizenship” for immigrants in the country illegally. Mr. Bush’s own plan failed in Congress and has long been deeply unpopular with the party’s conservative base. Mr. Trump took full advantage of the backlash against Mr. Bush’s plan by taking a much harder line. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in March found that 56 percent of Republicans do not favor a path to citizenship, up from 38 percent who held that position early in Mr. Trump’s presidency. But Mr. Bush continues to make the case, put forward by his allies in the business community, that a more welcoming immigration policy, including an expansion of some work visas, is needed to modernize the economy and expand prosperity for native-born workers. Over the weekend, Mr. Bush called on congressional Republicans to tone down their “harsh rhetoric about immigration” and urged them to enact comprehensive changes.",Political News,4/20/2021
General Warns of Challenges to Tracking Terrorist Threats in Afghanistan After U.S. ExitsThe military is examining where it can reposition troops to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a terrorist base.By Eric Schmitt,"WASHINGTON — The top American commander in the Middle East said on Tuesday that it would be “extremely difficult” for the United States to watch and counter terrorist threats in Afghanistan like Al Qaeda after American troops leave the country by Sept. 11. The head of the U.S. Central Command, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., offered the first extensive comments by a top commander about the effect of President Biden’s decision to withdraw more than 2,500 American troops from Afghanistan. Mr. Biden rejected the advice of top Pentagon and military advisers to keep a small force in place. Among the major challenges once troops have left will be how to track and potentially attack militant groups in Afghanistan, a landlocked nation far from any major American base. General McKenzie said the administration was discussing with other countries where it could reposition forces to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a terrorist base. Possibilities in the region include Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, but those countries are under the sway of Russia to one degree or another, and the sanctions the administration imposed on Moscow last week complicates any such discussions, diplomats and military officials said. Attack planes aboard aircraft carriers and long-range bombers flying from land bases along the Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean and even in the United States could strike insurgent fighters spotted by armed surveillance drones. But the long distances are costly and riskier. “It’s going to be extremely difficult to do, but it is not impossible,” General McKenzie said under questioning from both Democrats and Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee. General McKenzie told lawmakers that he was working on a detailed set of alternatives that he would deliver to Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III by month’s end. But he underscored what Mr. Biden’s top intelligence officials have already warned: Without boots on the ground or armed surveillance drones just minutes away, the United States will have far fewer human or electronic eyes and ears focused on extremist threats in Afghanistan. “The intelligence will decline,” General McKenzie said, “but we’re going to be able to continue to look into Afghanistan.” American spy agencies do not believe Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups pose an immediate threat to strike the United States from Afghanistan, an assessment that the Biden administration considered pivotal as it weighed continuing the war or pulling out forces this year. Al Qaeda and the Islamic State’s Afghanistan branch remain very weak inside the country, according to American officials briefed on the intelligence. Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan are focused on making local gains, not mounting international attacks. And the Taliban remains hostile to the group. How well the United States can monitor any changes in these threats will depend on many factors, General McKenzie and other senior military officials said. The administration currently plans to maintain an embassy in Kabul — but how many personnel, including intelligence analysts, will remain is under debate. “That will be helpful if we maintain an embassy there,” General McKenzie said. Flying remotely piloted aircraft like the MQ-9 Reaper from the sprawling Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar requires round trips of up to eight hours, leaving much less time for drones to hover over targets in Afghanistan. As a result, the Pentagon would need many more drones to achieve 24-hour coverage in multiple areas of the country at a time when the Defense Department is looking to transfer surveillance aircraft to missions in Asia. General McKenzie said that the military would not sacrifice precision in its targeting to minimize the risk of civilian casualties. “We’re going to make sure we have a precise target, and that we’re going to be able to control what happens there,” he said. The implications of Mr. Biden’s decision continued to sink in on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Several top Biden administration officials, including Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Zalmay Khalilzad, the longtime lead U.S. diplomat involved in the Afghan peace process, provided classified briefings on Tuesday to several socially distanced groups of lawmakers, and discussed the president’s decision. General McKenzie made one point clear in his public testimony: No more combat troops. And no more civilian contractors. (There are more than 16,000 in Afghanistan, including about 6,000 Americans.) “We’re going to go to zero in Afghanistan,” he said. Representative Michael Waltz, a Florida Republican who served in Afghanistan as an Army Green Beret, expressed concern with the lack of ready-to-go alternative bases. “General, do think it would have been optimal to have those agreements before we announced to the world that we’re going to zero in a few months?” Mr. Waltz asked. General McKenzie said talks with other nations in the region were underway. Administration officials said they were considering basing drone operations in Central Asian countries, including Uzbekistan, whose Karshi-Khanabad base was a logistics hub for operations in Afghanistan until Uzbek officials ordered the United States to leave in 2005 in protest over a United Nations operation to relocate Uzbek refugees who had fled during an uprising earlier in the year. Akhror Burkhanov, a spokesman for the Uzbek Embassy in Washington, said he was unaware of any current discussions about possible basing arrangements. The C.I.A. once flew drone missions out of Shamsi airfield in Baluchistan Province in Pakistan, which has expressed support for the Afghan peace process. But many American and Pakistani analysts say it is highly unlikely Prime Minister Imran Khan would approve any basing arrangements given the fraught history of C.I.A. drone strikes in Pakistan’s tribal regions. General McKenzie, as well as other military and intelligence officials, noted the advances in surveillance technology since Sept. 11, 2001, as well as myriad ways that the United States had hardened its defenses at home from external terrorist attacks. “It’s a very different country,” he said, “than it was in the fall of 2001.”",Political News,4/20/2021
"One Year After ‘Tiger King,’ Bill Aims to Protect Big CatsThe Big Cat Public Safety Act has been introduced before, but a bipartisan group of lawmakers hopes the public outcry from the Netflix documentary series will finally help it become law.By Maria Cramer","The former roadside zoo owner known as Joe Exotic, Joseph Maldonado-Passage, remains in prison. The animal rights activist he was convicted of trying to kill, Carole Baskin, was given control of his old zoo in Oklahoma. But one year after the premiere of the Netflix series “Tiger King,” an unexpected quarantine binge hit that focused on their feud and the cutthroat world of roadside zoos, big cats remain unprotected from the exploitative practices the series helped reveal. Now, a bipartisan group of United States senators has introduced the latest version of a bill designed to keep unlicensed individuals from owning tigers and other big cats and forbid zoo owners from letting the public pet the animals or hold cubs. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, introduced the Big Cat Safety Act last year, but it did not make it to the floor for a vote. Mr. Blumenthal said he was hopeful that with Democrats in control and some Republicans already supportive of the legislation, this is the year the bill will finally clear the Senate. “What I’ve seen is a groundswell of support,” Mr. Blumenthal said on Tuesday. “I don’t want to overstate it, but it really seems like an idea whose time has come.” Two Republicans, Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Richard Burr of North Carolina, agreed to introduce the bill on Monday with Mr. Blumenthal and Senator Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat. “Big cats like lions, tigers, and cheetahs belong in their natural habitats, not in the hands of private owners where they are too often subject to cruelty or improper care,” Ms. Collins said in a statement. The bill is similar to legislation that Representative Mike Quigley, Democrat of Illinois, introduced in 2020. That bill, which would have allowed breeding and transporting of big cats only by educational facilities, and wildlife sanctuaries and zoos that restrict direct contact between animals and the public, had 230 sponsors and was passed by the House in December. Sara Amundson, president of the Humane Society Legislative Fund, said the Big Cat Safety Act had the support of law enforcement organizations and dozens of zoos and sanctuaries, giving it “significant momentum.” “Whether it’s Joe Exotic, Doc Antle or Joe Blow, we can’t permit private individuals to keep big cats captive for pleasure or profit,” she said in a statement. “These operations endanger the public and produce the worst possible fate for the animals involved.” Under Mr. Blumenthal's bill, it would be illegal for a private individual to transport big cats across state lines, breed them or own them. Zoos, sanctuaries and other exhibitors and organizations that are licensed by the Department of Agriculture or by a federal facility registered with the department would be exempt. Under the bill, no zoo or exhibitor could allow direct contact between members of the public and the animals. The law already requires all zoos to be licensed federally, according to Mr. Blumenthal’s office. Ms. Baskin’s organization, Big Cat Rescue, has long pushed for the Big Cat Safety Act, which was first introduced in 2012. The organization has been calling for a ban on cub petting for more than 20 years. “There is almost nothing more adorable than a tiger cub, and it’s very understandable if you don’t know the back story to want to pet a tiger cub and take a picture with it,” said Howard Baskin, Ms. Baskin’s husband and the treasurer and secretary of Big Cat Rescue. “It’s a miserable life for the cub.” The documentary was criticized by conservation groups and animal rights activists for not focusing enough on the abusive practices of roadside zoos and instead playing up salacious details, including the mystery around the disappearance of Ms. Baskin’s first husband. More tigers live in captivity in backyards, roadside zoos and truck stops in the United States than remain in the wild, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Before his arrest and conviction, Mr. Maldonado-Passage was a major breeder and seller of tigers and other big cats, who churned out cubs for profitable petting and photo sessions. When they became too big and dangerous for play, he disposed of them. Some were sold as pets to private buyers and others went to other roadside zoos for breeding. Some simply disappeared. The documentary’s footage of baby cubs being ripped from their mothers so they could be petted by the public shocked many viewers. Since then, state legislators have introduced their own version of bills that would ban such practices. Keith Evans, president of the Lion Habitat Ranch in Las Vegas, which has 31 big cats, said he was worried that legislators have become too reactionary and that the new laws being passed around the country could create bureaucratic entanglements that would punish responsible zoo owners. “The way some of the bills are worded, they’re wide open to interpretation,” he said. “There are enough rules on the books that if they just enforce them it would make everybody happy.” Mr. Blumenthal said the bill he introduced was meant to protect big cats from cruel and dangerous practices, not hamstring responsible zoos and sanctuaries. He said the bill had been referred to the Environment and Public Works Committee, which Mr. Carper chairs. “My focus is on preventing abuse and exploitation of the big cats and safeguarding the public,” Mr. Blumenthal said. “Those two goals are paramount.”",Political News,4/20/2021
